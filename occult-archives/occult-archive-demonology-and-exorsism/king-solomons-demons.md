In the mists of ancient history, around the 10th century BC, legend speaks of King Solomon, ruler of the Israelites. Whether fact or fable, the Old Testament paints him not only as a wise monarch but as a formidable conjurer, binding an army of demons under his dominion. It’s whispered that God’s divine gift to Solomon wasn’t just wisdom but also the arcane knowledge to command the supernatural.

*The Testament of Solomon* offers a tantalizing glimpse into the ranks of these spectral beings:

**Agares**: Master of tongues and tremors, he speaks every dialect and stirs the earth into quaking fits.

**Asmodeus**: Representing the sin of unbridled lust, he stands as the third among the famed seven deadly sins.

**Baal**: Once revered for his blessings of bounteous harvests, Baal was feared for his fiery rituals, where children were said to be consumed in flames. A fatal clash with Mot banished him to the shadowy depths of the underworld.

**Barbatos**: The gentle whisperer of beasts, every creature’s voice is an open book to him.

**Beelzebub**: The demonic aristocracy recognizes him as their prince, and his form—a monstrous fly—stands testament to his ghastly royalty.

**Beleth**: A tempestuous fallen angel, only the bravest of magicians dare summon him. With a hazel wand and a sip of wine, they might stand a chance to bind his wrath.

**Belail**: Embodied temptation, he ensnares souls through carnal desires and forbidden allure.

**Bifrons**: A ghoulish entity, he plays wicked games with the deceased, stealing them from their restful slumber and leaving them adrift.

**Caim**: Once an angel, now fallen, he takes the guise of ethereal birds. With a touch of ash, he unveils cryptic prophecies.

**Dantalion**: The silent infiltrator of thoughts, he bends minds to his whims.

**Glasya Labolas**: A bloodthirsty sentinel, he revels in the scarlet aftermath of violent ends.

**Halpas**: Bringer of fiery cataclysms, cities crumble in his wake.

**Kunopegos**: Oceanic terror, he rides tempestuous waves, sending sailors to watery graves.

**Obyzouth**: Heartbreak incarnate, she leaves a trail of unfulfilled maternal hopes.

**Ornais**: Stalker of Aquarius-born, this vampiric shapeshifter hungers for their essence.

**Ose**: A masterful deceiver, he cloaks individuals in delusions of grandeur.

**Phoenix**: With a siren’s song, this avian lures souls to their doom.

**Sabnack**: Wielding disease as a weapon, he inflicts painful afflictions upon the unsuspecting.

**Shax**: Deafener of kings, blinder of queens, this demon pilfers only to return the treasures in an age far removed.

**Valefor**: The tempter of thieves, he lures many into the shadowed path of larceny.

**Vepar**: Mermaid of malevolence, she wreaks havoc upon seas and seafarers alike.

**Zepar**: The barrenness bringer, he denies many the joy of parenthood.

Solomon’s legacy with these entities remains an enigma, a mesmerizing blend of myth and mystery, forever etched in the annals of the arcane.
