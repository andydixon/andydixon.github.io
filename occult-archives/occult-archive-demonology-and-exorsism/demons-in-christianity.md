**Abaddon**, the Harbinger of Twilight: Veiled in dread and often spoken in the same breath as Satan, Abaddon, to the ancient Greeks, was known as Apollyon. With his name chanted in forbidden incantations, he exacts dark deeds upon the world.

**Abraxas**, the Duality Weaver: Positioned high in the demonic hierarchy, the Christian scrolls whisper of Abraxas as a demigod. With a single utterance, he can conjure dichotomies of truth and deceit, sanctity and sin, luminance and gloom.

**Behemoth**, the Infernal Monarch: This name resonates with darkness throughout Christian folklore, often serving as an alternative title for the devil himself.

**Belphegor**, the Alluring Ennui: Representing the sin of sloth, this demon occupies a unique throne. In the oddest of rituals, excrement is presented as homage. Beware, for Belphegor can don the guise of a captivating maiden, ensnaring men into infidelity’s trap.

**Gadreel**, the Serpent of Eden: The whisperer of temptation, it was Gadreel’s silken words that led Eve astray, setting mankind upon a path of knowledge and sacrifice.

**Isacaaron**, the Illusionist of Desire: A sower of forbidden yearnings, Isacaaron lures both men and women towards illicit trysts and forbidden passions. His power extends to conjuring phantom pregnancies, blurring the line between reality and illusion.

**Lucifer**, the Morning Star Turned Dark: Though now a symbol of malevolence, Lucifer was once a beacon of light, an angelic figure before his infamous descent.

**Satan**, the Embodiment of Malevolence: Synonymous with all things wicked, Satan’s very name sends a shiver down the spine. His titles are many, but his intent remains singular: to champion the cause of evil.

Dive into these tales with caution, for within these chronicles lie the enigmas of the nether realms, where shadows dance and demons reign.
