**1. Basic Money Candle Spell:** Channel the power of green (the universal color of money) and purity (white) to beckon wealth into your life.

**Ingredients:**

- Green Candle
- White Candle
- Oil (of your choice)

**Procedure:**

1. Anoint (or “charge”) your candles with oil, visualizing your financial aspirations.
2. On your altar, place candles 9 inches apart.
3. Ignite them and recite: *“Money, money come to me,* *In abundance three times three,* *May I be enriched in the best of ways,* *Harming none on its way,* *This I accept, so mote it be,* *Bring me money three times three.”*
4. Daily, for 9 days, shift the white candle an inch towards the green. Maintain your visualization.
5. On the last day, let the candles touch and burn completely.

**2. Money Knot Ritual:** Intertwine the physical act of knotting with intent to bind your wealth wishes to reality.

**Ingredients:**

- 13-inch green silk thread

**Procedure:**

1. Craft nine evenly spaced knots.
2. With each knot, chant the respective line of: *“By knot of one… By knot of nine, these things are mine.”*
3. Display the knotted thread prominently at home.

**3. Money Voodoo Lamp Ritual:** (Use with caution) Invoke Legba, the powerful Loa, to aid in your quest for wealth.

**Ingredients:**

- One coconut
- Candlewick
- Heart meat
- Bones
- Oil
- Red wine
- Two small sticks

**Procedure:**

1. Halve the coconut and stabilize it on a tray using three stones.
2. Insert a bone into the heart meat.
3. Place them inside the coconut. Drizzle seven drops of red wine over them, invoking Legba with your wishes.
4. Pour hot oil on them until the coconut is half-filled.
5. Create an X using two sticks and position the wick between them. Immerse the wick’s bottom end in the oil.
6. Keep the flame alive until your wish materializes.

**Warning:** Engaging with powerful Loa like Legba isn’t for the faint-hearted. Misuse can bring unintended repercussions.

**Remember:** Rituals aid in channeling energy and intent, but always conduct them with respect and caution. Your intent should be pure, and harming none should always be a prime directive.
