Candle magic is as much about intuition as it is about ritual. Observing and interpreting the signs in candle magic provides valuable insights that can guide your future practices and offer clarity regarding the energy at play. Here’s a comprehensive understanding of what to look out for:

**Post-Spell Practices**:

1. **Post-Spell Calm**: Take a few moments post-spell to relax and center yourself. This period of stillness allows you to reset and transition smoothly from a ritualistic state to your everyday state.
2. **Cauldron Use**: A cauldron can be an excellent and safe place to let candles burn out. It’s both practical and symbolic.
3. **Extinguishing Flames**: Whether you decide to blow out a candle or snuff it out, let your feelings and intuition guide you. There’s no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach; your intention and respect are what matter. However, it’s advised not to blow a candle out as it would lead to depleting some of the power of the spell.

**Observations**:

1. **Flame Behavior**: A vibrant, tall flame might suggest strong, positive energy, indicating a powerful spell, while a weak flame might suggest otherwise. Flickering or dancing flames can indicate the presence of spirits or external energies.
2. **Smoke and its Patterns**: Smoke rising in a straight path indicates clear intentions and possibly successful outcomes. If it wafts about, external forces might be influencing the spell. Also, observe shapes or symbols in the smoke; they can be prophetic or provide clarity.
3. **Black Smoke**: Thick, black smoke might suggest negativity or obstacles. It’s a sign to cleanse and protect.
4. **Wax Residue Reading**: Also known as Ceromancy, it’s the art of reading melted wax. As the wax solidifies, it might form symbols or patterns. These are clues to the spell’s outcome or energies surrounding the situation.

**Interpreting Wax Residue**:

- **Rings or circles**: Represent cycles, completion, or the idea that events come full circle.
- **Mountain-like shapes**: Indicate obstacles ahead.
- **Human or animal shapes**: Can represent specific people or attributes related to that animal.
- **Hearts**: Indicate matters of love or emotions.
- **Droplets or tears**: Can symbolize sorrow or situations that provoke emotion.

Remember, intuition plays a significant role in these interpretations. Personal experiences and feelings at the moment can offer the best insight.

**Final Thoughts**:

Candle magic, with its rich history and symbolism, provides not only a way to manifest intentions but also a means to understand the energies at play. By regularly practicing and recording observations, you can sharpen your intuition, making your spell work even more potent. Remember, patience, practice, and introspection are key.
