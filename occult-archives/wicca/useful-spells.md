**🌟 Salt’s Protective Dance 🌟**

Protecting your space has never been so salty and sparkly! Ready to send away those negative vibes? Grab that salt and let’s dance under the moonlight.

**You’ll Need**:

- Salt (sparkling, if you can imagine!)
- A night with the Full Moon in all her glory

**Moonlit Steps**:

1. With your salt in hand, start a moonlit dance outside your home. Start your groove at your front door.
2. Shimmy and sprinkle in a deosil (that’s clockwise) rhythm around your home. Just don’t rain on any plants’ parade!
3. As you sprinkle, chant with flair: “Sparkling salt, guard this groove! Keep away the negative and make our vibes smooth!”
4. Close your dance at the front door, strike a pose, and declare, “This house is a negative-free zone. And that’s how it’s gonna be!”

**🌈 Healing Hug 🌈**

Let’s dive into the universe’s hug! It’s healing, it’s warm, and oh-so loving.

**All You Need**:

- A heart ready for some love
- Your magical hands

**Steps**:

1. Take a deep breath and clear your mind. Only good vibes are invited!
2. Place your hands over your heart or wherever you feel the love.
3. Imagine the universe’s love flooding in, filling you up with all its rainbow goodness.
4. Feel the energy dance from your hands to every corner of your being.
