WHERE AM I GOING TO…?

A rarely-trodden route, over-grown  
and strewn with pitfalls

Dangers lurk if I should stray –  
but I cannot see the Path, and I wander from the track

No signpost: “To The Abyss”. No  
map, no guide, no shelter.

Who knows the way?

One who has gone before.

From his lonely heights, beyond the  
awesome gap,

He sees me slip and struggle on  
again

He cannot and he will not aid me  
now.

The journey from this world

This way the truth, all things

You have to make it on your own.

I hesitate; no looking back

The point of no return

I stumble on as darkness falls

No starlight as I seek to reach the  
stars

The way I came is hidden; the way  
ahead unknown

I am lost.
