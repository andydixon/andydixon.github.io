Review: FRUITS OF YGGDRASIL

Everyone  
has heard of the Runes, those mysteries angular symbols carved on stone or  
printed on card, but few know their real uses. For so long, the Runes have been  
regarded as merely another fortune-telling device, simplistic interpretations  
delineated in book after book, with little or no acknowledgement that the Runes  
are part of an ancient religion. Odinism, the beliefs of the Northern peoples (centred in Scandinavia) has  
survived centuries of persecution and a distortion which continues today.  
Realisation is gradually dawning that the Runes are part of a dynamic and  
effective system of Magick.

For the  
first time, a Priestess of Odin is making this information publicly available.  
Fruits of Yggdrasil is a recording of the chanting of the Runes by Freya  
Aswynn, a reconstruction of the traditional invoking and channelling of their  
power as was done thousands of years ago.

This  
professionally-produced record has a backing by the controversial musician  
Patrick Oâ€™Kill; harmonising with each Rune-Chant are sounds varying from the  
melodic to the sinister, musical creations which alone would be fitting  
backgrounds to ritual and which here blend perfectly to evoke the mood of the  
Runes.

Sounds  
are vibrations, all of which have an effect on the atmosphere. The correct  
sound produces the intended effect and that is the purpose of Magick. The Runes  
are not asthenic marks scratched on a piece of paper, they are living potent  
spells.

Available  
on long-playing record, cassette and compact disc; also book just published.
