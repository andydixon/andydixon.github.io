Another tradition has been  
established – the DL guest-spot. Announcing a new magazine, a product or a  
project, something of interest to all Occultists or to a specialised section.  
Let us know in plenty of time if you wish to participate – the guest spot in  
DL6 will announce the launch of the new magazine ABRASAX. In this issue:

END TIME BULLETIN

It must be nearly five years  
since the first two issues of End Times Bulletin were produced, the series  
being brought to a premature end when the editor was asked to write a book.  
Since then, other business has had to take priority.

But now the Millennium is five  
years closer, so it’s time to try ETB out again. On a small scale, looking to  
publish two or three times a year, starting in October 1988.

To make a success of what will be  
primarily a news and comment journal, with some backgrounds articles, ETB will  
need a participative readership, sending in news clippings, rumours, religious  
tracts, prophecies, threats, stories of doom and gloom, the new age, geological  
disaster, disease, the Antichrist, Armageddon, and all the other components of  
the Twentieth Century Apocalyptic Vision.

All  
contributions will be credited and it is hoped to provide free copies of the  
first issue to those who have helped. Please send anything which may be of  
interest to:
