DIALOGUE BETWEEN ADEPT AND PUPIL

Part 7

PUPIL: I recently saw a ghost. It  
seemed quite real at the time, and I had no reason for hallucinating, but,  
thinking about it afterwards, I cannot rationalise what happened. Can you  
explain what are “ghosts”?

MASTER: What you see is the  
essence or energy but your subconscious fleshes it out to suit yourself – so,  
if you expect a ghost to be a headless horseman or a lady in grey, that is how  
it will appear. People will not see a headless horseman in a house, that would  
be incongruous.

Everything  
is composed of energy and this is why only a minority of hauntings occur  
outside. It is difficult to charge anything outside, there is too much open  
space.

PUPIL: Are ghosts the same as  
visions?

MASTER:  
Energy is formless, timeless, sexless. When religion comes along, people  
suspend all logic. They expect a totally different set of rules to obtain in  
that situation, and it just isn’t on. There is only one set of rules for the  
universe and everything in it.

A  
disbeliever’s subconscious will not flesh anything out, but he will also be  
aware of the essence. An atheist never gets possessed.

Everyone  
is composed of energy. A strong personality is a preliminary indication of the  
amount of energy in that person.

Energy  
can be used to charge a room. I can make a room very uncomfortable for everyone  
in it or very comfortable.

The  
secret is to be aware of that energy and observe it without your mind  
artificially dressing it up. If energy is there, it is there all the time, only  
the reception differs.

PUPIL: Is a mirage a different  
phenomenon?

MASTER:  
Whereas a “ghost” is caused by one’s reception of the energy in a particular  
place, a mirage in the desert is an entirely subjective occurrence. Lack of  
water causes an increase in other chemicals in the body; fear of dying  
increases adrenalin. Physically a man may be on his hands and knees in the  
desert, but, if he is a non-spiritual man, he has long lost control of where  
his mind is.

PUPIL:  
If we are all composed of energy, an Adept should feel like several megatons.  
How do you prevent this energy in you from affecting other people?

MASTER: I neither transmit nor  
receive. Or I do, but I shroud it. One cannot “close down” completely but one  
can cloak it.

PUPIL:  
Is this to prevent harm to other people or to protect yourself from receiving  
too many impressions?

MASTER: Both.

PUPIL:  
Are the things in the future so unpleasant that you do not wish to see them –  
but you must have seen them, because you have spoken about them. Like your insistence  
that traditions have a value, they must be maintained because their abolition  
would create a vacuum which would have to be filled by something.

MASTER: I know what is waiting  
in the wings to replace abolished tradition.

PUPIL:  
Why can’t you tell me?

MASTER: You will understand that  
when you are ready to know. I cannot describe to you things that you cannot  
comprehend; I know you cannot comprehend them because, if you could, you would  
not need me to explain them to you. To tell you what those things are would be  
like someone who has reached the top of a mountain describing the view to  
someone who is only halfway up. However detailed the description, it would be  
nothing like seeing it for yourself.

PUPIL: Is Adepthood perfection?

Master: If you are perfect, you  
are totally without balance. Without balance because it is all one thing.  
Eliminate perfection and imperfection. There must be some perfection and some  
imperfection. In the same way, a person who is 100% masculine or feminine would  
have no physiological balance.

PUPIL:  
But an Adept is so far above ordinary people, surely that must be what we call  
perfection?

MASTER:  
Qualities add to your responsibility, not to your superiority. It means that  
there are less excuses for you and more for everyone else who does not possess  
those qualities.

PUPIL: At least you have some  
human feelings, such as your love for your dog.

MASTER:  
How many other species do you know? So how can you say that love is a human  
emotion?

PUPIL: I  
thought you said you could not love.

MASTER: It is not a question of  
loving or not loving, it is a question of doing things in balance.

PUPIL:  
So we get back to this thing about balance again.

MASTER: We never left it.  
Without balance, nothing is achievable, there is no past, not future, no  
progress.

PUPIL:  
What is the balancing factor in your love for your dog?

MASTER:  
There is no balancing factor; you take a balanced view as far as love in itself  
is concerned. There is day but there is also night. My love for my dog is not  
an extreme and irrational thing, it is thought-out like everything else I do.

PUPIL: Is love balanced by the  
opposite emotion?

MASTER: No, it is a balanced  
thing in itself. It does not rely on emotion, it is not demanding.

PUPIL:  
Do you think I have achieved a balance in my love for you?

MASTER: Only you can answer that  
for yourself.

PUPIL: And I think I’m getting  
there. Though there are setbacks, of course. But, hastily changing the subject  
(and thereby showing just how much progress I haven’t made), we were talking  
about something much more interesting, Adepts. Are there different grades of  
Adept?

MASTER:  
Pursuit of the Occult is the pursuit of knowledge. Knowledge is knowledge.  
Every Adept knows the same things as any other Adept. The more you know does  
not make you any better, it increases your responsibilities and increases  
everyone else’s excuses. The minute you start feeling superior, check yourself,  
something is going wrong.

Equate  
energy with power. Power is like electricity, it is neither good nor bad.  
Energy cannot be created nor destroyed. Power without responsibility is  
dangerous. An increase in power leaves less room for error on your part.  
Ignorance is bliss; that proves the equation a second way.

PUPIL: This seems to relate to  
the isolation which we discussed earlier. I no longer get annoyed by people’s  
bad behaviour in mundane matters – for instance, when they don’t return  
borrowed items or don’t say thank-you for help. I thought this was because I  
simply didn’t care about them.

MASTER:  
Nothing must have the power to affect you. One of the first things that happens  
as you move along the path is that you no longer belong to a particular place.  
If you do not belong to a place, the only thing you can belong to is a time.  
You are alive here and now but that does not mean that you belong to this time.

PUPIL: I have never felt that I  
belonged to any place, never felt any emotional attachment to any country or  
area. It would never matter to me where I lived, providing it was somewhere  
comfortable.

MASTER:  
You will eventually reach a stage in your development where your situation is  
totally unimportant.

PUPIL:  
All right, I know I haven’t got so far yet! But, to go on to the next thing you  
mentioned, time. In DL2, you referred to the different “cells” from which one’s  
body is composed having existed at different times. Is this what you are  
talking about now?

MASTER: Partly. You could have a  
large proportion of cells from one time. But there is one particular time that  
is your and you have to find that time.

PUPIL: How?

MASTER:  
You fit into the time, it does not fit into you. You will know the time to  
which you belong in the same way that you know your own coat in a dark room  
even if you had to pick it out from twenty identical coats.

Balance  
what was then against what is now. Try each time to see what fits.

PUPIL:  
How does one start? By reading about the different eras and seeing which ring  
any bells?

MASTER:  
You have to start by reading, or some other method of gaining knowledge about  
that era, but then you must think about it. Go into that era, try it on like a  
coat and see if it fits.

PUPIL: You said ‘or some other  
method of gaining knowledge about that era’. I first became aware of the time  
which I think may be mine when I saw a film about events that took place then.

MASTER: Films and television are  
very useful because they can bring us more information in a few minutes than we  
could gain by several hours’ reading.

Pupil:  
So they save time, not waste it?

MASTER:  
Nothing is wasted. Even fictional drama was written by human beings; you should  
think about what they have written and analyse it.

PUPIL:  
Discounting the profit motivation, they write to entertain, sometimes to put  
across propaganda. It used to seem strange to me that my viewpoint is so  
different from what appears to be “the average”, but I think I can now see  
where it really is me being different or merely the writer trying to convert  
people.

MASTER:  
Everything you read or see can be useful to you. Everyone’s personality is made  
up of different facets. Reading or seeing events of a dubious quality can  
trigger recognition within the reader/viewer; if it does that, it triggers  
identification. If it is dubious, it is hard to climb above it afterwards.  
There are so many books available today that it is easy to end up with the  
wrong role model. If your subconscious or personality has identified with  
something, later in life you will gravitate towards that thing. All the time it  
will shackle you to the earth. Most of today’s entertainment for children is  
symptomatic of man’s descent into crudity. The Greyfriars of previous  
generations is now Grange Hill. What your mind reads can surface a lot of years  
later in many peculiar ways. There are books which, if read by a mature mind,  
can be entertaining and even instructive, but, if you read them when you are  
too young, before you have any real experience of your own, they can have an  
overly large effect. At the time when you read or see things, it does not have  
any real effect; what matters is what you do afterwards with what you have seen  
or read. The lightest of books, written solely for entertainment, is still  
written by a human being, with a personality, featuring day-to-day events,  
problems, solutions, descriptive passages referring to a scene, a viewpoint.  
There is no point in reading anything if, afterwards, you do not analyse it.  
This is part of the process of learning to use everything instead of being  
used.

PUPIL:  
Like when one has an illness – instead of saying ‘now I can’t go potholing any  
more’, think of something that one now  
has time to do. Or take the view that one is no longer risking one’s neck at  
weekends. Though that raises another question – you said that some people need  
danger. How do they cure themselves – or should they try?

MASTER: Danger is like a drug,  
more addictive than heroin. But you are equating danger with taking silly  
risks, and there is no connection.

PUPIL:  
Oh. Yes. I see. I’ve done it again – taken a viewpoint without thinking about  
it. ‘Question yourself constantly’ – you’ve said that several times, and I do  
try, but some things slip through. Maybe I’ll catch them next time around.

MASTER: People claim that they  
wish to know themselves, but most, even, if they are not aware of it, would do  
anything to avoid finding out.

PUPIL:  
How does one try to find out?

MASTER:  
The method is for the individual to select. Do something or stop doing  
something. One cannot give someone a set of exercises. Your mind and body has  
to work in the knowledge that you yourself designed the situation. If someone  
has done that for you, it reduces you to the level of soldiers in battle, there  
because they were ordered to be there.

Create  
the situation, remove as many safeguards as possible and see what happens.  
Examples are undertaking a long journey on foot without stopping; starving  
oneself almost to death; engineering a situation in which one has a 50% chance  
of survival. You have got to make sure before you start, that you are strong  
enough not to judge, not to like or dislike, but just to experience and  
observe. Observe yourself, observe the feelings that are generated.

When  
you take up a serious study of the Occult, you are climbing into the ring with  
your subconscious, fighting for supremacy not just in this life but for all  
eternity. You can use the dirty tricks which the subconscious uses.

PUPIL: I  
know you said it was going to be hard,  
but it is harder than I expected.

MASTER:  
The Occult is the study of yourself and the universe in yourself which relates  
directly to the external universe. If you think this is hard, you have seen  
nothing yet.
