A QUESTION OF DEGREE

There are as many modes of  
working as there are groups. No-one can arbitrarily judge what is the “right”  
method and what is the “wrong” method because no-one but the members of the  
group is qualified to say what those people want. If they choose to dress in  
robes and dance around a circle, they will join a certain group; if they feel  
that they are going round in circles metaphorically as well as literally, they  
will either resign from the group or look for something deeper within its teachings.  
And then, if they find something deeper (within themselves or within the group  
gestalt), they may try to force it on the other members who would rather be  
left alone to get on with their dance.

All  
groups carry the seeds of their own destruction within them, if their High  
Priest, or whatever title he holds, considers it part of his duty to mend the  
cracks, he is not fulfilling his true function, which is to help others in  
their development. If a group is a vehicle for a High Priest’s ego, there is  
nothing wrong with that, as long as the members are happy to be worshipping at  
his feet. Some, especially at the beginning of their interest in Occultism,  
need that kind of safety-net and they seek involvement with others by  
participation in ritual and other workings. Most would not be happy with the DL  
set-up, which is not a “group”; the Adept speaks to each pupil individually and  
no-one else knows what has been said unless that pupil chooses to discuss it  
with others.

There  
are no “phoney” groups, only groups which a member has outgrown. It is a  
question of degree. There are kindergartens, primary schools, comprehensives  
and universities, and, however talented the pupil, he/she is better prepared by  
progressing through the system than by enrolling at university straight out of  
the cradle. Those who choose to remain in the Occult kindergarten do so because  
it fulfils their requirements.

The  
question of dangers, of stirring up something that one cannot handle, has been  
exaggerated. Even the weakest High Priest knows that, sooner or later, a  
monster is going to pop up, and, if he cannot zap it back from where it came  
from, he had better abandon the Occult right now and take up knitting. He has  
to have some modicum of skill, to keep his members happy, and this is usually  
sufficient. He does not need to understand the real nature of the bogey or its  
origins, as long as he can keep the lid on it. When his members want to know  
more, they will move on.

A danger  
comes when a kindergarten Occultists tries to move up before he is ready.  
Although he could not pass the university entrance exam, he might be accepted  
at comprehensive simply on the grounds of the length of time spent in the  
playgroup. A rigidly hierarchically grade-structure is a valid means of  
safeguarding all concerned, not least the upwardly-mobile junior member.

Some  
will tell you it is wrong to remain on a level, that you must be forever  
pressing onward and upwards. The Occult is not like that, and real life is not  
like that either. However, the majority of us have come from the ranks, missing  
a grade here and there according to individual preferences and abilities. If  
you look back and say “I learned nothing at all from that group”, the fault is  
probably yours.
