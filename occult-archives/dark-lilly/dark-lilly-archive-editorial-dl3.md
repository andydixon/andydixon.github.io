Editorial to DL3

Editorial  
policy is that there should be as little editorial policy as possible imposed  
on DL. As our readers have observed, there have been conflicting opinions  
expressed, and we expect that this will continue. DL gives you plenty to think  
about, but does not tell you what to think.

Probably  
you have heard the (true) story of the salesman’s job advertised stating a  
potential earnings of £100,00 per annum; no-one applied. The same job  
advertised at £20,000 per annum attracted a hundred applicants. They put their  
own value on their abilities. Most Occultists do the same. There are a few who  
are determined to reach Adepthood no matter what the cost, but the majority,  
who have progressed far enough to know themselves, know that they do not wish  
to handle the responsibility which such power entails. After all, the  
£100,000-a-year salesman got ulcers and a heart attack, and that was only a  
job.
