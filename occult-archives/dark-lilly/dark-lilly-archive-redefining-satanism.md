Re-Defining Satanism

The slogan “Evil is Live spelt backwards” was  
effective (though “Devil” on the same principle put us in the past  
tense) but its shock value and therefore usefulness has long since receded. It  
is now counter-productive if being evil is regarded as a necessary  
qualification to be a follower of the Left Hand Path. So let us relegate that  
myth to the junk-heap, along with the other nonsense about Satanism being an  
offshoot of Christianity (even the Christians’ bible testifies against that).

Satanism is no longer a hook upon which the  
unenlightened can hang their guilt complexes. Two thousand years of being the  
“scapegoat” has inevitably left us on the defensive. In any  
statements for public consumption, we have expanded too much time ands energy  
in explaining what we are not, and this preponderance of the negative has  
created a void rather than a valid exegesis. Now we are once again being  
accused of sacrificing babies and indulging in illegal sexual acts. People  
assume that we gain some advantage by so doing, though no-one has ever detailed  
how such acts could increase Knowledge, and Knowledge is what Satanists are  
seeking.

Orthodoxy substitutes Faith for Knowledge. No-one can  
form an objective judgment without experience, but experience is forbidden to  
the followers of establishment religions. Belief is demanded. Centuries ago,  
this may have been a useful contribution to the stabilisation of Society  
(though the excesses of the Inquisition and similar efforts in all European  
countries and their colonies give rise to some doubt about this method being  
justified).

However, in the present day, it is illogical to think  
that the survival of nations and alliances would be affected by people’s belief  
or lack of belief in any religious system. Freedom is today’s demand, and  
freedom of thought is one of the essential liberties.

Probably the greatest question on Earth is the  
inescapable fact of death. Freed from the tenets of orthodoxy and its  
improbable placebos, we want to know what really happens when our mortal body  
ceases to function. We also wish to learn how to become more effective whilst  
on Earth, how to achieve in many ways. Myths and legends do not interest us. We  
are concerned with Reality. We want to know. These four words summarise the  
satanic quest.

We do not believe that some mysterious and awesome  
deity (whether or not he has horns and a tail) is going to hand us that  
Knowledge in return for our allegiance (or that problematic entity the  
“soul”). Knowledge is achieved by learning, working, experimenting,  
experiencing and thinking. That is why the orthodox religions fulminate against  
us, because they are aware of the insecure foundations of their own dogma. It  
is our existence that threatens them.

Faith is the true evil. Blind, unquestioning faith in a  
religion or a cause has made men go to war, commit unspeakable acts of  
persecution and terrorism against other human beings. The Satanist does not  
offer such allegiance. It is his principle to ask “Why?” One little  
word that could shatter empires. No wonder they are so afraid of us.
