WE, THE ECCENTRICS

One of the  
distinguishing features between genuine and phoney Satanic organisations is the  
genuine Satanists’ acceptance and encouragement of individualists.

(Definition of  
genuine: one which offers real knowledge and therefore power.) {NB WORD GENUINE  
IS BOLD}

In the phoney  
groups, all must conform because individualists would be a threat to the power  
and prestige of those at the top. The High Priest needs his followers, needs  
the crutch of their adulation, far more than they (if only they could see  
clearly enough) need him.

Satanists  
recognise that the individualist is the only worthwhile type. A Satanic High  
Priest does not need to vampirise his followers: his energy comes from within  
himself. Of course he gets a lot of admiration, because the people who have the  
wit and wisdom to follow his teachings recognise that here is a very special  
man. However, he does not need them. And they (once he has provided the initial  
impetus) do not need him. If anyone finds that statement disturbingly heretical

- yes, I like shocking people, it sometimes does them good, but, in this  
    instance, I mean it. To take the best-known example: you would not be where you  
    are today if you had not read The Satanic Bible, {NB THE SATANIC BIBLE IS IN  
    BOLD\] but if (perish the thought!) Dr LaVey had retired from being a Satanist,  
    you would not retire too. A great idea is bigger even than the great man who  
    formulated it.

Self-sufficiency  
is a vital feature of Satanism and it sets us apart from all other ways,  
whether occult or orthodox. Variations from the normal can only be accorded  
true acceptance when there is no normal, and Satanism is the one way that has  
never needed to set a normal because it recognises the individual.

A way of life which  
promotes self-sufficiency naturally nurtures quite a few real eccentrics. I  
remember one Satanist who lived in a motorised caravan because he didn’t want  
to see the same view every day (well, that’s what he said). He usually stayed  
around the same town because he had a very respectable job, which he liked and  
did well, but, on a date with him, one never knew whether one would be spending  
the night in the Municipal Car Park or in the woods five miles out of town.  
Usually the woods, because we made too much noise and disturbed the winos in  
the car park. The squirrels and rabbits never objected; in fact the squirrels  
would take nuts from his hand.

I have noticed  
that quite a few Satanists have the ability to communicate with animals. This  
must be distinguished from the woolly-minded white-witchery sentimentalities,  
some of which even go so far as to upset the balance of Nature (for example,  
saving the seals caused a drastic shortage of fish). This communication is  
usually on a one-to-one basis and has nothing to do with emotionalism. I know a  
very advanced Satanist who goes shooting and fox-hunting; his dog and his horse  
have a better rapport with him than most humans could achieve.

People who think  
for themselves may occasionally come into conflict with the system, but, in  
most cases, it makes more sense to duck and dodge rather than to adopt directly  
confrontational tactics. Eccentrics are tolerated, some are even admired – but  
drop-outs make the place look untidy. It is not a case of stridently demanding  
the right to do one’s own thing (who, incidentally, has the right

to confer that  
right?) We simply do our own thing. It does not harm anyone else; if it upsets  
some people, that is their problem. Heard of the recently-announced christian  
terrorist tactics as the fundies step up their campaign? The white witches are  
running scared, but it would be really funny if those misguided bigots targeted  
a Satanist. Regrettably, it seems that sense (for once) prevails.
