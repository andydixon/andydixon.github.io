Crossing the Abyss

The word  
“abyss” implies something unpleasant. The connotations are that it exists to  
keep something in, or, in this case, to keep people out. It is there to deter  
rather than to restrain.

There is  
nothing pleasant about the word “abyss”. Other words such as  
”chasm” or “canyon” do not carry the same hint of menace. The Grand Canyon is  
not terrifying (unless you fall into it) but imagine a similar geographical  
feature called the Grand Abyss. The word “canyon” does not trigger a warning;  
the word “abyss” does. But it is the same thing. A gap, a space between one  
place of land and another.

The  
Abyss is that awful thing you go through or across to get to where you think  
you want to be, that is, Adepthood. And then you find out that the Abyss was an  
understatement because, when you get to the other side, you see why it exists,  
to keep people out. When you are on the other side of it, you truly realise  
that most contact or communication with other people at any real level is  
finished forever. Your values change, most of your yardsticks by which you  
measure have been altered. You realise why the Abyss is just that, to keep  
people out.

You do  
not cross it in one go. It is not a ferry-ride. You work your way across it day  
by day. This is not sailing across the Channel. You work your way slowly across  
the Abyss.

Everybody  
does it differently, but they all stick to the task in hand and the main  
concern is subduing your own subconscious and its lies. Some days it does not  
give many problems, other days you might fall into the same trap two or three  
times. Before you are aware of it, you are either thinking or speaking from a  
stance, or you listen and react to someone without realising that they are  
speaking from a stance. This serves to remind you that you are not yet as  
accomplished as you thought you were.

The  
Abyss represents the difference between one state of mind and another.

You can  
cross the Channel from Dover to Boulogne; you can also cross from Boulogne if  
you find tat you do not like France. You cannot re-cross the Abyss because that  
would involve unlearning and unknowing, which is impossible.

There is  
no question of choosing to take the Right Hand or the Left Hand Path. There is  
only one route. You either cross or you do not cross.

But what  
you do when you get to the other side is entirely up to you. You then have  
access to everything.
