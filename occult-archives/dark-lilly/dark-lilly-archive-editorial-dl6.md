EDITORIAL – DL6

Several  
readers have asked for advice on the direction of their Occult studies. As they  
are not members of the Society and therefore not known to me personally, only  
general guidelines are possible and these have been given in earlier editions  
of DL. For those who feel that they are progressing satisfactorily, try this:  
define Good and Evil.

In the  
next few issues, we will publish as many replies as possible. No-one will judge  
which essay is “best” – the benefit is that, by expressing your view, you may  
be aiding your own progress and/or that of others.

From the Dark Lily Journal No 6, Society of Dark Lily  
(London 1988).
