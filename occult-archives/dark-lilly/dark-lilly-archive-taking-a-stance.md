TAKING A STANCE

If you take a stance you are  
being manipulated by external matters: by events or people over which you have  
no control, and therefore you do not have proper control over yourself. It is  
easy to see why one should avoid stances. It is far from easy, however to do  
it.

Remember the character in “Alice  
in Wonderland” who believed six impossible things before breakfast? A useful  
exercise, perhaps. But yesterday I nearly took six stances before breakfast. I  
say “nearly” because I was aware that getting annoyed by the incident would  
have been a stance and I managed to avoid it (I think).

STANCE ONE: a noisy vehicle woke me half an hour before I  
needed to get up. STANCE TWO: having gone back to sleep, I did not hear my  
alarm, so I overslept. STANCE THREE: the milkman was late and I only had enough  
milk for my cats, so I had to manage with lemon tea. STANCE FOUR: the newspaper  
boy dropped my paper in a puddle before pushing it through the letter-box.  
STANCE FIVE: the telephone bill arrived. STANCE SIX: an important letter  
(posted first-class two days ago) didn’t arrive.

Later I  
analysed how those minor irritations could have had far-reaching consequences  
if they had put me in a bad moon for the rest of the day (the  
”getting-out-of-bed-on-the-wrong-side” syndrome). As it happened, there were  
some important events at the office, and, if I had let those stances stay with  
me, I could have created considerable problems by mishandling something or  
someone. Because I had analysed the stances and dismissed them, I was able to  
cope even better than usual, having had this immediate reminder of the  
necessity for not taking stances.

Even for  
those not aspiring to Adepthood, the advice not to take stances is valid. It is  
so much easier to cope if nothing has the ability to upset you. It doesn’t mean  
not caring, it means not being affected. The “unruffled” person is always  
popular. Good advice for living. Consider how much better things would be, from  
personal circumstances to global affairs, if people did not take stances and  
thereby evoke stances in others.
