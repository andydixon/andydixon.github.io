Continuing  
our “mirror-image” series. The alternative view of a quality or a situation  
which is generally regarded as a Good Thing or as a Bad Thing. In DL8, we  
featured the serious subject of Humour. Now we consider Happiness:

THE GREAT ILLUSION

Are you  
happy?

Well, it depends what you mean by  
happy.

So, how  
could we define happiness?

The  
dictionary says: “Lucky; fortunate; contented with one’s lot”. To be lucky  
would induce a temporary happiness, but even the euphoria of winning the pools  
is transitory. To be permanently happy is to be contented with one’s lot, and  
that means to have no ambitions, no plans, no dreams. In other words, happiness  
is stagnation.

Yet “the  
pursuit of happiness” is put forward as one of humanity’s ideals. It is easy to  
see why a sensible government would like its people to be happy.

What  
would make you happy? To have more money, a better job, to achieve a good  
relationship with another person? Such attainments, however desirable they may  
seem, would increase your responsibilities, you would seek to expand them  
further. Ambition would ensure that you never rested content.

Can you  
recall the last time you were truly happy? Not a care in the world? Was it a  
sudden stroke of good fortune; or had you had one glass of wine too many?  
Either way, it was ephemeral.

We are  
told that becoming an Adept means that one will never be happy again. Perhaps  
because of the awesome responsibilities, perhaps because one sees things too  
clearly. I believe that every aspiring Occultist has said goodbye to the  
illusion called happiness. Contentment does not co-exist with ambition.

Further contributions to this  
“Alternative View” series, or comments on the opinions expressed, are invited.
