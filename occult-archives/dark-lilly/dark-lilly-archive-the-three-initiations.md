THE THREE INITIATIONS

There are probably more myths  
about Initiation than about any other aspect of Occult endeavour. Naturally the  
subject arouses strong feeling and one’s views change as one progresses. This,  
incidentally, illustrates the problem confronted by any non-Adept writing about  
Occult subjects: what I say now represents the sum of my belief and knowledge  
on this subject at this time. Having recently winced at the errors in an  
article I wrote five years ago, perhaps I shall look back at this and admit I  
made mistakes here too. Still, it would not be a good thing if no-one but  
Adepts wrote articles. For all of us struggling along the road to Adepthood,  
the inter-action is a valid aid to progress. I may have stuck my neck out more  
times than Anne Boleyn but – mistakes and all – here I to again.

The  
dictionary defines “initiate” as “admit (person) especially with introductory  
rites or forms, into society etc”. The general view of initiation is that the  
applicant makes his/her vows to the group which he/she wishes to join and to  
the deity which that group worships; in return for those promises, the  
applicant is admitted to membership of that group.

So, in  
this general view, there are three parties involved: the applicant, the group  
and the deity. The form which this first initiation takes varies widely, but  
the same tripartite arrangement applies in principle in all cases, even when  
the neophyte is unable to contact a suitable group and therefore undertakes  
self-initiation into his selected Path.

The  
second initiation comes when one has realised that there is no external deity,  
that the gods exist within one’s own subconscious, as aspects of self. At the  
second initiation, there are only two participants, the initiate and the Adept  
who is his/her teacher.

I  
believe that the third initiation involves only one person, the initiate, and  
the vows are to self only, for this is the entry into Adepthood. In other  
words, the Crossing of the Abyss, where one truly stands alone.

Maybe  
someday I shall be able to report back and state whether my views on the third  
initiation were correct.
