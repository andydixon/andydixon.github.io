Magda’s Letter to LOT (issue 23)

DEAR EDITOR: When I wrote the article THE TRUTH ABOUT THE DRUIDS (LOT21) which caused the massive mailbag in LOT22 the intention was to make people THINK about their cherished beliefs; defend them or reject them instead of stagnating in uncritical acceptance. Trouble was, I got tired of the game before it started. Because those myths really are just windmills, its not worth the energy of tilting at them… and I thought they were millstones, holding people back. Maybe quite the reverse; hold on to those myths, because they will keep you safe. Discard them and you venture in that perilous land that might lead to the Abyss. Magdalene Graham. Lincs.
