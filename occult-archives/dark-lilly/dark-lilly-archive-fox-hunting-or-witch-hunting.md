Fox-hunting or Witch-hunting

What is  
the difference between a witch-hunt and a fox-hunt? Compare the modern way of  
getting rid of foxes and the modern way of getting rid of witches. A fix is a  
fox, but a witch is a witch because someone say so. That is the creation of a  
fox where no fox exists.

Regarding  
fox-hunting, all that men did was to tag on to something which exists anyway.  
Dogs chases foxes just as naturally as they chase any other animal which is  
smaller, or sometimes larger, than themselves. There are tens of thousands of  
livestock deaths per year due to dogs. Animals’ instinct is to kill, and the  
only way to stop that is by genetic engineering.

When  
people talk about the barbarity of hunting, they forget what barbarity really  
means. Like the German description of a hypocrite, which translates as:  
‘preaching the water and drinking the wine’. The argument against fox-hunting  
is purely political, concerned to induce a feeling of guilt into those who  
disagree with the views expounded, and it concentrates on emotionalism,  
ignoring inconvenient realities.

I enjoy  
fox-hunting. The “burn-the-witch” brigade enjoy what they do. The end result is  
the same except more foxes escape than witches did. If people could get away  
with it, the would still burn witches today, because the same minds are still  
in the same organisations. The clergy do not even consider that burning people  
was wrong; they have never uttered an apology for the witch-burnings. They wish  
they could still do it, but, since the law no longer permits them to tie anyone  
to a stake and light a fire around him or her, they have found subtler methods  
of persecution. One particular section of society cannot leave other people  
alone.

Can you  
guarantee that no anti-blood-sports campaigner will ever chant  
“burn-the-witch”? I will give up field sports when people give up hunting other  
people because they are different.
