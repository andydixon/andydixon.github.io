GODS

“The  
only gods are between your ears”. That is the truth, but it is extremely  
difficult for most people, Occultists or non-Occultists, to accept. And, even  
when logically accepted, there remains the emotional feeling that, somewhere  
out there, something or someone is concerned about what happens to us.

A  
novice’s first objection to the statement with which this article commenced is  
usually that he has conducted a ritual or made an invocation to a god, say  
Lucifer, and that Lucifer has responded or his presence has been felt.  
Certainly there was a response, but that response was in the supplicant’s own  
head. It was nevertheless real. The response came from a part of the brain  
normally undisturbed. Your own subconscious contains the universe. Accepting  
that and learning how to utilise it are major steps on the way to achievement.
