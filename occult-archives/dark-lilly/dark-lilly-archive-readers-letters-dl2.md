READERS’ LETTERS

An amazing publication – I have never previously read anything that gave  
such a clear indication of the way of the Adept. I appreciate that you cannot  
put too much in a magazine, but even the first issue gave more information than  
I have seen before,. Why should anyone want to become an Adept? And yet there  
are many who do, and perhaps a few who will make it. Is it possible for you to  
provide individual instruction?

A series of papers is in production – for details. See Page

Thanks  
to the pioneering work of Lamp of Thoth and others, I am sure you will have  
received a more cordial welcome than would have been the case some years ago,  
when most Pagans seemed to be terrified of the LHP. There is a better  
understanding nowadays and DL has an important contribution to make to the  
Occult scene.

I found Dark Lily very interesting and informative and I  
loved the feeling coming from the words. I had the impression of  
sophistication, truth and a load of beautiful arrogance.

The first issue of DL gave me more information than any other Occult book  
or mag I have ever read. Please can you tell me how to contact the Master – I  
want to sit at His feet.

The only person allowed to sit  
at the feet of the Master is his dog. Humans have to make themselves useful  
What talents do you have to offer?

It’s pleasing to encounter a mag whose typist is competent in grammar and  
spelling. There are some Pagan mags which give the impression of semi-literacy.  
This is not nit-picking. If an uncommitted person picked up such mags as – and  
–, he would justifiably conclude that, despite their professed concern for  
ecology, Pagans are an uneducated bunch who don’t give a damn for a far more  
precious heritage, our language.

We “censored out” the names of  
the culprits because we do not have time or space to carry on unproductive  
disagreements.
