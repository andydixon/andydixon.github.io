A MEDITATION ON DARKNESS

All life begins in darkness;

 the  
darkness of the womb or the soil.

Light is false. Only darkness is  
truth.

Light is a reflection of shadows,  
light can be

 reflected,  
refracted, bent.

The speed of light is not the  
ultimate.

Darkness of the absence of  
transmitted light,

 free  
from the intrusion of falsity.

Colours change in the darkness.  
Blood is black.

 All  
cats are grey at night.

Darkness is the time when Man faces  
himself.

In darkness, he can comprehend  
infinity.

From the Dark Lily Journal No 1, Society of Dark Lily  
(London 1987).
