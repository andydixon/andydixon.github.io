THE CHURCH’S GUILT

Continued’

Why are  
Christians so anxious to accuse Occultists of child molestation? Because the  
best form of defence is attack, and the Christians are on the defensive here…  
with good reason.

The Catholic  
Church’s insurers estimate that, by 1995, the Church will be liable for  
financial damages of over ONE BILLION DOLLARS to the victims of sexual abuse by  
clergy. Over $25 million has already been paid.

The Church’s  
normal method of dealing with abuse is to transfer the guilty priest to another  
parish (where he is free to commit similar offences) and to put pressure on the  
victim’s parents to take no action for the sake of the Church’s reputation.  
Fortunately some parents are more concerned for their children than for the  
Church. Dozens of such cover-ups have been established in Court (the number is  
increasing so rapidly that any figure quoted would be out of date by the time  
this is printed). In the diocese of Orlando, for example, molestation of  
children by priests has been known to the diocesan authorities for OVER FIFTEEN  
YEARS but the Church took no action against the guilty priests.

The Catholic  
Church has been forced to establish psychiatric centres to treat persistently  
offending priests. The numbers of such patients referred by their diocesan  
superiors now total thousands (and these are the ones whose cases have not been  
exposed in Court.)

The Rev.  
Thomas Doyle, a high-ranking Catholic official in Washington DC, told the New  
York Times that paedophilia is “the most serious problem the Church has  
faced in Centuries”. He estimated that, of the Catholic Priests in the  
USA, the number of paedophiles was approximately THREE THOUSAND.

The Church  
Mutual Insurance Company has issued guidelines relating to child sexual abuse,  
admitting that paedophiliac offences by priests and other Church officials  
“happens at churches of all denominations and at church-operated camps,  
schools and day care centres”. It advises that the church institute a  
thorough screening and reference-checking in respect of applicants. The  
insurers now recommend that churches check arrest and conviction records and  
fingerprints all applicants.

The President  
of Church Mutual Insurance Company has been quoted as follows: “the  
problem of sexual abuse of children and growing wave of lawsuits alleging  
sexual abuse is a real one. It is being felt by churches and church-related  
institutions of all denominations.” In many cases it has been found that  
the church was negligent for hiring the offender, in supervising the children  
and in failing to take appropriate action when cases of abuse were reported or  
suspected.

Because the  
Christian dogma insists on submission, children are especially vulnerable to  
offences committed by those whom they have been taught to revere. Their parents  
are also vulnerable to clerical pressures. The cases which come to court are  
only the tip of the iceberg.
