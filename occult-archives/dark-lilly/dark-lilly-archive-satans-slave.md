“SATAN’S SLAVE SEEKS YOUR SOULS”

“DEMON QUEEN SPREADING POISON”

WHO, ME?

There are certain  
responsible Occultists who are working very hard to contain matters, to improve  
our image, gain acceptance, and end the abusive misunderstanding of our selves  
and our views. I am one of them; I know what a task we have taken on – and I  
sometimes wonder why.

Reading the  
vitriolic gutter-press attacks on Occultists, it seems to me that it is the  
author rather than the subject of attack who is sick. Having been involved in  
Occultism for most of my life, I find it difficult to comprehend that there are  
still people who think of Occultists as dangerous perverts. I am a successful  
businesswoman, have done a great deal of work for animal welfare and other  
charities… and I am a Satanist. That wipes out all the plus-points, does it?

Afterthought:  
Satan’s slave seems to be a stock cliché. Maybe it’s just the alliteration  
which makes it popular, or are they trying to imply that we are trapped, and/or  
that we try to trap others? I could quit Occultism today if I wanted to, and  
the same goes for every other Occultist I know. We don’t want to, because the  
advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. So, when you consider the problems  
which we have to face, that at least proves that the study of the Occult gives  
us a hell of a lot…
