READERS’ QUESTIONS (DL6)

Are you really Left Hand Path at all? If so, why  
don’t you support the crusade against oppressive religions?

Left  
Hand Path or Right Hand Path are opposed like capitalism and communism.  
Communism supplanted capitalism with its own customs which were, in fact,  
exactly the same. Card-carrying members instead of aristocrats. Only the label  
had changed.

Buddha,  
Allah, Christ, all those names are labels and nothing more. It is how you  
recognise things. It is natural to wish to label things, but, because the label  
has fallen off, the contents of the jar have not changed.

People  
want to do everything in groups. Human beings are still tribal. But there is a  
nasty trick waiting at the end. People are especially anxious not to die alone,  
but no matter where you are, how many people are around you, at that moment you  
are totally by yourself. But you have to die to find that out. That is what  
traps people.

The  
warriors of the Left Hand Path fell into the biggest trap of all when they  
started fighting Christianity from the other side of the way, glorifying  
everything that the Christians vilified and vice versa. That is like saying  
there are two sets of rules for two sets of people. In fact there is one set of  
rules for everyone and the whole universe.

So it just became another  
little war. But a lot of people are happier living up to their necks in the  
trenches, rather than finding out what the war is really about. If enough  
people refused to report to an army, where would the war be then? This Occult  
war is just as pointless because, while it is being fought, people are  
interested in the war and the battles. They are not thinking about themselves,  
what they should be doing, where they should be going, what kind of people they  
would be if they were not in this uniform, fighting this war.

It is  
a cheap way out, because, while you are fighting that war, you have no chance  
of becoming an Adept, which is as well for a lot of people.

It  
does not matter to the Adept or would-be Adept what anyone else believes in. It  
matters even less what anyone else thinks of him or her.

Can you answer these questions for me, and please  
tell me if you think these questions are relevant at this stage:

(a)   
What is the subconscious?

(b) Is the subconscious in control only because people have  
previously thought it to be in control?

(c)   
Is it in control only so that  
we can learn from the experience of mastering it, which would perhaps prove to  
be beneficial practice and training for whatever work lies ahead, beyond this  
stage?

(d) Why isn’t the subconscious benevolent?

(e)   
Why doesn’t it want to be  
stirred from its slumber?

Your  
questions regarding the subconscious certainly are relevant, as it is vitally  
important to your progress that you understand the subconscious and its  
effects.

(a) The subconscious is a part of the mind; the first part to be  
developed in primitive man, and it has changed very little in thousands of  
years. It is a separate entity, independent of you although within you  
(probably the origin of the myths of “possession”) and is the part of the mind  
that makes you do things which are not in your best interests: such things as  
putting off tasks which need to be done, or taking a stance, when you would be  
better able to deal with the situation if you had not got upset or enthusiastic  
about it. You have probably heard the expression: “a prisoner of his own  
personality”. In this context, “personality” means “subconscious”, though few  
people using the cliché realise it.

(b) You ask: ‘Is the subconscious in control only because people  
have previously thought it to be in control?’ Quite the opposite, in fact. Most  
people have no idea that their subconscious is firmly in control of them. They  
believe that they are in charge, that their conscious mind, the reasoning,  
rational mind, directs their thoughts and actions. In most cases, it does not.

In the article about  
stances in DL3, the writer tried to show the damaging effect that is caused  
when the subconscious is in undisputed control. They are such insignificant  
little incidents, they normally pass without being noticed; but they do leave a  
very significant residue of feeling upset, bad-tempered or “out of sorts”.

(c)   
The subconscious mind  
is not in position simply to provide a useful exercise for the prospective  
Adept. However, dealing with the subconscious mind is one of the first and most  
vital tasks for anyone wishing to make spiritual progress.

(d) The subconscious is not benevolent towards the host body and  
mind because it is a separate entity which seeks to maintain its own existence  
and that existence is inimical to its host. Being benevolent would mean  
allowing the conscious mind to take charge and thereby the subconscious would  
be contributing to its own downfall/expulsion.

(e)   
Most people never rouse  
the subconscious by questioning its activities. They drift though life and the  
subconscious finds it very easy to control them. When someone starts defying  
his subconscious by refusing to take stances, the subconscious realises that  
something is wrong; it has to wake up and fight to defend its position.

It fights by making its host body and the conscious mind  
very uncomfortable. The subconscious can easily induce fear, self-doubt, a  
multitude of phobias, and most powerful of all, guilt. All very effective in  
deterring the conscious mind from its bid for supremacy.

The only way to fight these actions of the subconscious is  
by self-discipline and single-mindedness. Know your enemy; learn to recognise  
these actions of the subconscious and how to analyse them. Do not over-estimate  
your will-power and strength of purpose, and never under-estimate your  
subconscious. Undertake to yourself that you will abide by a specific code of  
conduct and never deviate from it. It is even more difficult than it sounds,  
but most who seriously embark on this task will recognise quite swiftly the  
immense benefits which accrue from avoiding stances, and that should inspire  
them for the further and greater efforts which will be demanded.

A stroke of genius, not putting by-lines on  
articles. Even if we may, by now, be able to recognise the styles of one  
or two regular contributors, we still have to study the article thoroughly  
to be able to do so. So you achieve your stated object of getting readers  
to assess an article’s worth solely on their view of its content. But  
there must be some articles which you, the Adept, know are giving wrong  
information. Why do you publish these?

The  
articles you specified, and others, represent a different (not incorrect)  
viewpoint seen from a different (whether more or less advanced) stage of development.  
If you disagree with what they say, analyse why, either for your own benefit,  
or, if you let is have your analysis, for the benefit of other readers.
