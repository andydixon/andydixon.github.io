A further extract from

A PUPIL’S DIARY

Before  
beginning to look for a solution, one must first define the problem. That  
sounds logical. If only I could be sure what the problem is.

The fact  
that an Adept does not think or act like an ordinary human being is not the  
problem. The problem is my reaction to this situation. I try to accept it, to  
adjust to it, but it’s like catching quicksilver.

I think  
I know him fairly well, insofar as it is possible for any human being to know  
him, yet I can very rarely predict his response to any event.

I think  
the answer is BALANCE. Balance, as he said, is the key to everything. Look for  
the balanced reaction to any occurrence or statement and that is where  
he will be.

Providing  
I can figure out what is the balanced way.

In the  
early stages, one tries to equate balance with what one feels is the right  
thing to do. But the “right thing” is a dangerously subjective judgement.

To take  
just one example: I thought it was the right thing to save the seals. But those  
pitiful little furry creatures, allowed to multiply unchecked, drastically  
reduced the fish population. So Nature is now restoring the balance.

A world  
from which suffering had been eradicated would be as unbalanced as a world  
ruled by one mad dictator. It is emotionally difficult for me to accept that,  
because I want to provide plentiful supply of Whiskas for every cat in the  
world. I care about cats more than I care about anything else; and that could  
be an unbalanced view if I let it.

But how  
am I to prevent it being unbalanced? I am not at present in a position to do  
much for animal welfare. Maybe there is some improvement to be noted in the  
fact that I no longer wish to adopt every cat that appears in the garden. There  
are logical reasons for that, which would not to have occurred to me a few  
years ago.

The  
feelings are still there, but they do not influence my actions.

If feeling  
is all right but doing something as a result of that feeling is wrong,  
then I am on the track. Is it so easy?
