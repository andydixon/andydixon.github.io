GREEN ISSUES

We have  
received many letters from readers concerning ecological matters, asking our  
position regarding the ozone, deforestation, recycling etc.

We offer no advice.

We consider all “green” questions rhetorical.

There is  
nothing wrong with the world or the environment. If every person obeyed every  
ecological instruction issued, nothing would change. There are simply too many  
people in the world. Fifty years ago, the population of the world was 50% too  
high. We do not advocate killing or enforced contraception. None of it is our  
problem. But, until this basic problem is addressed by the people whom it does  
concern, then all green issue remain verbal diarrhoea.
