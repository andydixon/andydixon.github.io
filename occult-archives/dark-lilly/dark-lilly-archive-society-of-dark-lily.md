Society of Dark Lily

A  
limited number of places have been created.

Applicants  
should preferably be ages between 25 or above (below that age, they are  
unlikely to have sufficient experience of life to know enough about themselves  
or anything else). However, younger people will be consider, provided tat they  
can demonstrate a mature outlook.

A  
suitable candidate will probably be of a professional background,  
self-confident, adaptable, of flexible thinking, yet dedicated, single-minded,  
perhaps ruthless. He/she must be aware that the way to achievement is not  
purely by melodramatic ritual and magickal formulae. Applications from suitable  
couples are also invited. The methods of the Society of Dark Lily are not a new  
concept in Occultism but they are unheard-of in the mainstream of Occult  
systems, whose adherents would not have sufficient will-power and determination  
to benefit by this instruction.

This is  
not an Occult correspondence-club. Membership of the Society of Dark Lily it  
the way to real achievement, but, as readers of this magazine have often been  
reminded, power only comes with responsibility attached. If you have any doubts  
or hesitations, turn the page. If you think you have what it takes, write for  
an application form to:
