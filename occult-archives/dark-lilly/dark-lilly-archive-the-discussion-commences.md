THE DISCUSSION COMMENCES

A reader asks  
why we call ourselves Satanists. Very good question. Is there a good answer?  
(Later – yes, see below.) A reaction from a member of the DL staff was: If  
anyone could come up with a better name, some  
of us would be pleased. The principle that “the only god is between your  
ears” has been called Occult Atheism, but that is not really appropriate.  
I suggested the term “Selfian”; this doesn’t really cover it, but  
it’s the only idea anyone has had so far.

RESPONSE #1  
(from one of our regular correspondents): I have no suggestions for a new name,  
but I can think of a great reason to keep the old one and the symbols. If a  
person is so mentally constipated that he can’t get past a star and a circle to  
talk to me, I don’t want to talk to him. The trappings eliminate a lot of  
stupid people. It’s like a big filter. It saves me work.

RESPONSE #2  
(from the Editor of The Black Flame):  
Look at the Hebrew origin of the word, which was a title rather than a name and  
meant adversary, opposer, accuser. We are the adversaries, the Satans, who  
combat the ignorance and pettiness fostered by supernaturalist religions. We  
are not merely atheistic, we are anti-theistic. The Promethean resonance of  
Milton’s Satan is the heroic image we hold dear. This is the true Satanic  
aesthetic. We are living with his pride as our role model. And we are, in  
truth, the real Devils that the fundamentalist religionists fear, for we  
represent mental and emotional emancipation from the shackles of guilt and  
oppression which these theisms have fought to make a permanent part of  
Mankind’s existence. They always have feared children, as these innocent beings  
have always been vessels for the real essence of Satanism. That is why they  
want so dearly to control education, to crush these little Black Sparks before  
they can be ignited into the searing consciousness which will sweep away the  
anti-human claptrap with a single smoldering glance. But it really is too late  
for these outmoded primitive philosophies. The Sparks have fanned and a great  
conflagration of Black Flame is spreading. The fundamentalists will truly  
perish in the inferno of the human spirit, which shall crisp their mean little  
souls. Really, what other name than Satan can fully characterize our indomitable  
Wills? To our enemies, it symbolizes destruction and evil, and, since we are  
life-embracing and they are death-worshippers, this is literally true. Our very  
existence puts the lie to their carpings. We would rather reign in the Hells  
which we make, the havens which we mould by our own efforts, than be servants  
in a sterile heaven.

The word Satan  
also presents a psychological test, an abyss that few can cross. To call  
oneself a Satanist requires that you remove your “good-guy badge” and  
take a far more objective posture. You step beyond the hackneyed concepts of  
Good and Evil to arrive at true self-responsibility. It is just for the elite,  
but why not? The herd members can’t take it, even those atheistic  
fellow-travellers. Well, we want only those who can take it, who resonate with  
the Dark heart of existence. We are Satanists and nothing else will do.

RESPONSE #3  
(from a reader): I take your point about Selfian,  
but I do not think it would make any difference. It might stop other Occultists  
thinking we worship Satan, but we are not concerned about their opinions.  
However, to most people, we would still be labelled Satanists, and some of us  
cannot afford to let that happen. If I am asked to state my religion, I say I  
am an atheist. I am not apologising for this, because I do not see it as  
cowardice. There is nothing in Satanism which calls for martyrs – quite the  
reverse, in fact. If I thought that MY public declaration would do any good for  
Satanism, I would seriously consider it, but, quite frankly, I cannot see that  
my sacrifice (which would almost certainly entail loss of job) would have the  
slightest effect on anyone but me. So I keep quiet, earn an excellent salary  
and enjoy life as a good Satanist should.

Further comments are invited.
