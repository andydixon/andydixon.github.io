WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE?

I have  
been told that “Left Hand Path” and “Right Hand Path” are merely convenient  
labels to distinguish the routes to the Abyss. At that point, the distinction  
ceases: one either crosses it or does not cross, and, having crossed, the Adept  
has access to everything, so labels are irrelevant.

Accepting  
this, let us consider the two routes. Is one easier than the other? Is one more  
likely than the other to get us where we want to go? I am assuming that the  
intention is to cross the Abyss, but many Occultists would be horrified at this  
thought. Power and Knowledge – they couldn’t handle it. Maybe it’s the wise  
ones who know their limitations.

To  
enable the reader to assess the validity of this article, I should state my  
position: somewhere along the Left Hand Path. Struggling towards the Abyss. How  
far, I am not yet in a position to estimate, so my assumptions beyond a certain  
stage may be wrong. If so, I hope I shall, at some time in the future, be able  
to correct them.

Why does  
one want to become an Adept? Motivations differ. There has to be something  
beyond this life, and I want to know about it. Quite simply, there would seem  
to be no point in enrolling at university without intending to take a degree;  
and every Occultist has enrolled.

So let  
us consider the two courses available. I do not need to explain to the readers  
of this magazine that the notions that the LHP is “evil” and the RHP is “good”  
are too simplistic to be useful. If we spent all our time trying to do “evil”,  
we would have no time for personal progress. Similarly, it seems that many  
practitioners of the RHP dissipate all their energies in trying to help others,  
dealing with every request for healing, clairvoyant guidance, trying to put the  
world to rights at the expense of their own development. All very well if you  
have the time for it. But we who live in the everyday world have so many other  
calls on our attention: household routines, earning a living, relationships,  
etc.

I  
therefore conclude that the way to Adepthood is a form of balanced  
selfishness. Both words require further definition.

Selfishness  
means putting oneself and one’s development first, but this has to be done in a  
balanced way. “Balance” is far too complex for analysis here, but it is the  
prime requisite in all things and a balanced form of selfishness does not mean  
a churlish disregard for everyone else. Inter-action in the world is necessary  
unless one has chosen the life of the recluse (and this might be considered unbalanced  
selfishness). Other people will make demands on your time. Give them as  
much as they deserve and no more (and assess those amounts honestly).

There  
will be some complaints from friends with whom you are no longer involved in  
social activities. They do not share your aspirations and could not even  
understand them. Now you have time to think, to concern yourself with your own  
development. Note that I do not say “study”, because there are no books that  
will tell you how to become an Adept. A few books or magazines may give you guidelines,  
but there is no standard recipe for achievement. Some Adepts have attained  
their present eminence in isolation, others were, at the beginning of their  
journey, guided. I do not know if one method is better than the other, though I  
think it depends on the individual, nor do I know how far the instruction goes;  
probably not very far and certainly not all the way. No-one can be assisted to  
Adepthood, because the Adept must be able to do all things alone.

So,  
follower of the Left Hand Path, you have put yourself in a position where you  
can make the attempt. You are on your way, up that steep and slippery slope. It  
has been compared to climbing a mountain, but there are more pitfalls than on  
Everest and the Yeti is a friendly creature in comparison to the monsters you  
will encounter in your subconscious mind. For most people (not all, but far too  
many), the Right Hand Path leads round in circles, always safe in the lower  
slopes. Following the Left Hand Path, you might get where you want to  
go. The onus is on you, and that is where it has to be.
