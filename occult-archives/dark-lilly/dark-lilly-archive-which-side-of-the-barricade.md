WHICH SIDE OF THE BARRICADE?

I am a Satanist. A  
follower of the Left Hand Path. That frightens the orthodox religions, of  
course, but the problem is that it also frightens many Occultists.

With  
fellow-Occultists like some of those on the Right Hand Path, we don’t need  
enemies. We have plenty, however, and they are complacently watching the  
divisions within our ranks doing their work for them.

A considerable  
number of people enter Occultism without having totally discarded their former  
orthodox beliefs. Some find that progress within Occultism enables them to  
break free of the conditioning. Some are not able to male that progress. These  
crypto-christians on the Right Hand Path would like to assure everyone that  
they have nothing to do with the baddies, the Satanists, the Black Witches, all  
those wicked beings on the Left Hand Path. They accept the Christians’ view of  
us and propagate it in their anxiety to show themselves blameless.

What those thickwits  
do not realise is that they cannot make common cause with the enemy. If the  
Satanists could be driven underground/abroad or wherever, the Establishment  
would then have the leisure to turn on its RHP lapdogs; and it most assuredly  
would do so.

RHP sniping at the  
LHP was tolerated because we accepted that they did not know any better and  
that a few of them would eventually learn. In the present crisis, we can no  
longer afford to be so indulgent. They are doing the enemy’s work, so why  
should they not be regarded as part of that enemy?

There are some RHP  
Occultists who do understand that we are on the same side and that difference  
in theory and practice are matters for discussion rather than open hostilities.  
But they are in a minority. The less clear-seeing have a decision to make and  
they do not have much more time in which to make it. Stop pussyfooting around  
the edges where you are simply in the way. Either commit yourself to real  
Occultism or get back to the other side.

Shakespeare (as usual) said it much better:

“He which hath no stomach to this fight

Let him depart, his passport shall be made

And crowns for convoy put into his purse

We would not die in that man’s company

That fears his fellowship to die with us.”
