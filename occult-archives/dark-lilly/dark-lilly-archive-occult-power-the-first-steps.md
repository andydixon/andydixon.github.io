OCCULT POWER – THE FIRST STEPS

“Know  
Yourself” is an ancient maxim which will remain valid as long as any form of  
being possesses an individual brain. It is not the only achievement necessary  
but it is the first and one of the most difficult.

At an  
early stage, the pupil is asked to draw up a page with two columns: on one  
column he/she is to list faults or character defects, in the other column good  
qualities. And when the pupil looks back at this early effort, months or years  
later, how much will have changed? Or how much will he think has changed?

The ego is one of the first  
problems to be encountered and defined. The ego has nothing to do with taking  
normal care of one’s appearance, standard of work or performance in other  
respects. The ego does not relate to what you think of yourself; it is  
concerned about what other people think of you and the ego is what makes you  
concerned with other people’s opinions. This is the reason for the widely-known  
(and true) saying “an Adept has no ego”. An Adept cannot waste his time  
pleasing other people; he has advanced beyond the rules of convention. This  
does not imply that he deliberately sets out to offend. Anyone who has to live  
and work in the world must, to some extent, conform or appear to conform.  
Neither should that enforced conformity prove irksome to him. Nothing has the  
power to affect him. He does not need followers to reassure him that he is the  
greatest. He knows what he is, and he can only spare time for those who are  
useful to him and/or those who have the potential for real achievement.

The ego is a dangerous thing to  
an Occultist. It can lead him astray from his purpose, so the understanding and  
control of the ego is a task which must be accomplished in the early stages of  
Occult endeavour. The obliteration of the ego will take place at a much later  
stage in one’s development.

Another  
aspect of self is the subconscious. This too, is often misunderstood and  
misrepresented as an almost automatic gateway to enlightenment. In fact, the  
uncontrolled subconscious is a fraud, a phoney which will give you false  
information. It is a separate entity, an atavistic and undeveloped section of  
the brain which does not wish to be aroused from its lethargy. As long as it  
remains in charge, it will feed you false information, use your basic emotions  
and desires to control you, anything to delude you into leaving it alone. It  
must be recognised and exposed. The subconscious must be mastered, for it has  
mastered you since the beginning of your life.

The  
control of the subconscious is, like the control of the ego, not a task to be  
accomplished in one effort, but is a continuing endeavour throughout one’s  
Occult development. Start by recognising it; evaluate its communications and  
realise how much of a disadvantage to the host body the subconscious in its  
present for is.

The  
enterprise is far from easy, yet seekers for wisdom have always existed. Those  
who attempt to break out from the comfortable lethargy of the subconscious  
mind’s rule. Describing the situation of those who have not comprehended their  
thraldom, the cliché is “blissful ignorance”. Blissful because one is never  
aware of the ignorance. To win the war against the subconscious means that you  
will never be blissful again.
