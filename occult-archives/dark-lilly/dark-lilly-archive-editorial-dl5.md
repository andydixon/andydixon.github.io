EDITORIAL: DL5

Working  
on the assumption that our readers wish to advance their Occult knowledge and  
abilities, we have stated in every issue of DL that the first vital step is the  
understanding and control of the subconscious.

If you take a stance that is your  
subconscious manipulating you; it has caused you to give a response without  
analysing the circumstances. We are quite accustomed to receiving letters which  
say ‘yes, I have my subconscious firmly under control’ and then go on to say  
‘have you seen that nonsense which So-and-so wrote?’ or ‘why do you have an  
exchange advertisement with a magazine that I don’t like? Or some remark which  
makes it obvious to everyone except the letter-writer that his subconscious is  
still in the driving seat.

So there  
is another built-in safeguard to the system. No-one likes to admit that there  
is a power within his own mind over which he has no control and which, in fact,  
controls him, much to his detriment.

But the  
admission does not have to be publicly made. It is for the aspirant  
himself/herself to achieve sufficient self-honesty to acknowledge that there is  
a problem which he shares with ninety-nine point nine recurring percent of the  
population of the world. Then he has to decide whether or not to do anything about  
it.

Without  
control of the subconscious, nothing can be achieved. The first step is to  
accept the truth of that statement. Not easy? And it gets harder.
