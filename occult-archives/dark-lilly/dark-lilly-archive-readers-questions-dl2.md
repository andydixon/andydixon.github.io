READERS’ QUESTIONS

It is rather difficult at the moment to assess what  
you believe in, what you stand for. Certainly not the “traditional” image!  
Maybe things will become clearer in the future editions, and I look  
forward to them. Meanwhile, how would you react to such statements as the  
following, which was seriously propagated in a book which I recently read:  
in a cave in Tibet is concealed every invention which has ever been made  
and every inventions which will ever be made.

Before dismissing such ideas (and  
there are many similar ones) as too far-fetched, it is useful to examine them  
more closely. The cave exists, but it might just as well be in Stump Cross  
Caverns. Every invention that has been or will be is already here, only the  
future inventions have not been recognised or put together yet. How much real  
wonder that cave contains depends entirely on what year it is discovered.

I want to learn the responsible use of power.

Responsible use of power is  
nearly always non-use. The mistake that all would-be Occultists make is that  
they try to apply an Occult solution to a non-Occult problem. This is like  
trying to pass electricity through water-pipes. And people still think that  
Occult power is something akin to electricity; once you have learnt how to turn  
on the generator, you have got it. Real Occult power comes from knowledge, and  
the big trap is that, until one gets there, the individual does not know how  
much knowledge he or she can stand. Hence, again, “ignorance is bliss”. A rough  
equation: for every milligram of knowledge, the price is a kilogram of peace of  
mind (if you are lucky).

Starting such a controversial magazine, I am sure  
you have received a few curses and challenges to Occult duels. How do you  
react?

I do not know of anyone with  
enough power to do me harm. If another Adept wanted to do me harm, he would  
have to convince himself that what he was doing was right and justified and  
also he would have to convince himself that he would win. By and large, I would  
get as excited about an attack from an Occult source as a guy driving along in  
a tank would be concerned about an attack by a caveman waving a club. Leaping  
up and down on the tank, sooner or later the caveman would fall under the  
tracks. His end is of his own choosing the.

Why are there no by-lines on your articles?

By-lines  
would be counter-productive. If we stated that this article is by the Adept,  
this articles by one of his pupils, this by another pupil, this by a subscriber  
to DL, this by the editor of another mag, etc, each reader would automatically  
adjust his scale of belief, depending on his personal preferences. If the  
author of the article is not indicated, the reader assesses its validity solely  
on his/her opinion of the content. That is the object of the exercise.
