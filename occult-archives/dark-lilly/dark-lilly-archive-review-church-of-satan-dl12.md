There are many  
books which have made history, and one of them is the Satanic Bible. Twenty-five years ago, Anton LaVey took the world  
by the scruff ot the neck and dragged it out of two thousands years of  
Christianity-induced ignorance, misery and fear. Not a task to be accomplished  
overnight, nor even in a quarter of a century, but we are near to the fruit of  
Satan’s Master Plan.

The Church of Satan by  
Blanche Barton gives a fascinating biographical account of Dr LaVey’s life  
before and after the founding of the CoS,  
and much more. Magick that really works; anyone who has applied the precepts  
given in The Satanic Bible and expanded in this volume can assure you that,  
unlike all other books on Magick (yes, I said ALL), this really does work.

Amongst much  
previously unknown and surprising information, the greatest shock is the  
revelation of one of the demons which Dr LaVey unleashed. You may feel like  
screaming in fury when you think of the years when it seemed that this demon  
was devouring Us rather than Them, but (when you come down off the ceiling) it  
is possible to understand that drastic measures were necessary, otherwise  
Christianity would have staggered along its moribund path for another few  
centuries. No-one else would have dared to do it, no-one else could have so  
accurately estimated the steadfastness of Satanists and other Occultists. We  
have suffered casualties and the war is not over yet. But the tide has turned.

Unlike other  
religions, which produce a multitude of books and not much else, Satanism has  
concentrated on the practicalities. Comparitively few books have been published  
by the CoS but they are all indispensable and highly entertaining. The Satanic Bible was referred to as  
the first psychological self-help book and it will continue to benefit its  
readers. The Church of Satan by  
Blance Barton is a worthy addition to that small selection which must be read  
by every Satanist (and should be read by everyone else, to find out what they  
are missing).
