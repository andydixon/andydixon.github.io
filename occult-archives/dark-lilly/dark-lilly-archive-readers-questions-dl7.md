READERS’ QUESTIONS (DL7)

Why should we believe you, when what you say is  
often opposed to the general view of Occultism? DL’s views are not popular  
with certain other groups and, since your Society restricts its membership  
so stringently, what about the people who find themselves agreeing with  
you? Where do they go?

Leaving aside the question of the  
validity of a “general view”, you should only believe what you want to believe,  
what feels right for you. An attitude which appears quite frequently is the “witch-hunting”  
mentality or, even more regularly, a fear of other Occultists’ “witch-hunting”.

Orthodox  
religions impose restrictions; Occultism should not, but it sometimes does,  
perhaps because its practitioners are seeking to re-establish the comfortable  
security of their former faiths. Without experience, it is not possible to  
evaluate. A system which prohibits its adherents from experimenting with other  
ideas is revealing its own insecurity and trading on the insecurity of its  
followers. If you refuse to believe in, say, reincarnation, you will be  
expelled from your coven. They might be doing you a favour. You ask where would  
you go. Why do you feel the need to go anywhere? You are where you always have  
been, with yourself.

Since you are re-defining the Left Hand Path and  
Right Hand Path, do you also re-define evil and good?

The  
questions are not related. Many people, of whichever path or none, do not  
realise that good or harm is a subjective judgement until one has reached  
Adepthood and the power to see everything in true perspective.

That’s  
the real difference. Not being good or evil, but understanding what good and  
evil are.

You said in DL4 that not everyone has it in them to  
be an Adept. What qualities do you look for in a prospective pupil, apart  
from, obviously, hard-working and eager to learn?

This  
is a question which cannot be answered. I know who will make it and who will  
not, and I also know who will benefit from going part of the way, but there are  
no standard qualifications which all pupils must have.

Don’t even utter the obvious,  
because by speaking it you give it more credence. The attributes you mention  
are more appropriate to a junior clerk than to a potential Adept.

I had read that certain areas of the country can  
induce a feeling of exhaustion, being “drained”, and others can have the  
opposite effect. I’m not sure whether I believed in it, but I began to  
believe, since I personally experienced the effects in a certain place.  
Yet I’m still not sure. It felt real to me; is there any rational  
explanation for the phenomenon?

Everything  
is a matter of energy. Like rivers or electricity, energy flows from one place  
to another. Some places take more of the energy I have than others take. If I  
stayed in them long enough, I would, like a battery, become discharged. There  
are certain places in the country where I do not go. A few are the exact  
opposite, places which invigorate me, where I get more powerful instead of  
being drained. There is nothing you can do to alter this energy, it simply exists,  
in its various forms, and some of those forms are not compatible with certain  
individuals. (Remember non-compatibility does not mean hostility). Avoid the  
places which drain you or, if this is not possible, try to arrange things so  
that you compensate for the effects.

Can you tell me what is mean by “bad ground” and  
how one can “heal” it?

These  
are areas where a traumatic event or series of events has been absorbed by the  
ground, to the extent that it can be felt by a sensitive person. This is not necessarily  
the same as the energy forces referred to in the previous question, where the  
reaction varies with the individual. “Bad ground” is inimical to all. The  
influence can in some cases be strong enough to prevent plants, even weeds,  
growing on neglected soil, though this can be artificially created for  
propaganda purposes. Millions of gallons of disinfectant were pumped into the  
ground of a concentration camp; nothing will grow there for strictly practical  
reasons, though it is another interesting indication of the part that  
superstition plays in warfare and its aftermath.

You  
should only attempt to “heal” bad ground if it is essential that this be done  
and if you can foresee all the consequences of your action. At that stage, you  
will not need to ask me how to do it.

What do you think of mediums, people who purport to  
communicate with the dead?

People who summon spirits  
successfully are sure of an interesting conversation because they are talking  
to themselves, though probably they and their associates are not aware of this  
fact. One’s own subconscious contains the Universe, though most people find  
this difficult, if not impossible, to accept.

So much of the history of magick appears  
far-fetched, accepted by the credulous long ago, but of no relevance  
today. Does it matter whether people such as, for instance, Merlin,  
existed?

Merlin would appear to be the  
personification of an ideal, something which must be attained if what is, in  
effect, a young nation, can go any further. It does not matter whether or not  
he existed, or what ideal he represents, because it is something that was  
thought necessary at the time. The same applies to systems of Magick, which  
will continue to exist as long as people feel a need for them.

I understand the reasons for your advice not to  
take stances and I can see why this is vital to one’s progress. But there  
is one way in which I still take stances and I really don’t feel that this  
is harmful. When watching snooker, I take stances in that I support  
certain players and am pleased when they win. It makes the game much more  
enjoyable than if I did not care which player won. The reason I think this  
form of stance is harmless is because it ceases as soon as the game is  
over. Whether one of my favourites won or lost makes no difference to my  
mood as soon as I have switched off the television, it is simply of no  
importance. Am I right in thinking that this is one example of a  
non-harmful stance?

Be  
careful of thinking that there could be such a thing as a non-harmful stance;  
it may be the thin end of the wedge when you are not sufficiently advanced to  
be sure of your ability to avoid stances. Providing the outcome of the game has  
no effect on your everyday life, this form of participation is not dangerous,  
but keep a close watch on yourself. Beware that dividing-line. Holding your  
breath as a player pots the black is all good fun, but, when you switch off the  
television and go to make a cup of tea, are you whistling happily because your  
favourite player won, or clattering crockery because he lost? If so, the stance  
started after the game was over.
