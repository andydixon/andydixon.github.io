DARK LILY

The Reality of the Left Hand Path

EDITORIAL – DL7

Enclosed with this magazine is an explanatory sheet and  
questionnaire for the OCCULT CENSUS, a  
project launched and sponsored by the Sorcerer’s Apprentice (no other Occult  
organisation has the resources to handle such an undertaking). This is the  
first viable attempt in Britain to counter two thousand years of  
misrepresentation and persecution, and it is hoped that Occultists will prove  
themselves worthy of these efforts on behalf of all.

That includes  
YOU. Complete the form and mail it to the Sorcerer’s Apprentice – or never  
again complain about Occultists being denied their civil rights. You have your  
chance.

From the Dark Lily Journal No 7, Society of Dark Lily  
(London 1988).
