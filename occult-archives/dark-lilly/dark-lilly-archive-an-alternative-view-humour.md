An Alternative View: Humour

Why is  
it considered important to possess a sense of humour? Perhaps that should be  
the first thing to arouse our suspicions, since it is so universally regarded.  
People may be judged by which comedian they laugh at and which does not arouse  
their mirth. We all know the stress or embarrassment of making what we believe  
to be a witty or humorous remark and finding that no-one understand it, or,  
worse, they misinterpret it.

“If you  
fear something laugh at it and that will remove your fear.” It doesn’t work, so  
why has the cliché been perpetuated? Because it enables people to delude  
themselves (and others) that they do not fear whatever-it-is. So, instead of  
facing the thing, analysing it and your reasons for fearing it, you can hide it  
and pretend it doesn’t really bother you. Humour papers over the cracks,  
conceals them until they grow larger, it does not repair them.

Everyone  
is aware that he merits the accusation of pomposity uses “a little joke at his  
own expense” (another well-known cliché) to prove that he isn’t as  
self-satisfied as he sounds. The ability to laugh at oneself is useful –  
someone who takes himself too seriously becomes very dull – but the criterion  
is spontaneity.

Yet  
another cliché is “the saving grace of humour”, meaning that, without humour,  
everything would be exactly as it is anyway but without the self-delusion.

Consider  
the following joke:

Whose  
Famous Last Words were: ‘what the hell was that?’

Answer:  
the Mayor of Hiroshima.

First  
time you hear it, you laugh. Then you feel uncomfortable, even guilty, for  
having laughed at such a joke. Conversely, what happens when someone makes an  
unamusing joke? You smile, to be polite. Humour is a form of social  
conditioning and, as such, suspect.

Laughter  
may, in some circumstances, be spontaneous. Far more often, it is phoney. It’s  
an interrogation device: if I smile at you, I’m really on your side,  
sympathetic.

Watch a  
politician being interviewed: the number of smiles is in direct proportion to  
the immensity of the foul-up which he is trying to excuse.

We need  
a certain amount of laughter in our lives. My contention is that, when humour  
is taken too seriously, it reverses its polarity.
