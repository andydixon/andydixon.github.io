REACTIONS TO THE OCCULT CENSUS

Response  
has been tremendous. After so many centuries of hiding away in fear, Occultists  
are beginning to realise that the New Age will come about through their own  
efforts. Since DL has been actively involved in assisting the Sorcerer’s  
Apprentice to promote this project, we have received quite a few reactions from  
readers…

“What  
use is it?”

Inestimable.  
And, the more who participate, the greater the power.

“Is there really no danger of  
breach of individual confidentiality?”

None  
whatsoever.

“How can  
I help?”

Fill  
in a form. Get all your associates to fill in forms.

The response continues to grow,  
demonstrating the integrity and commitment of many thousands. However, there  
are people (even some Occultists) who are very good at lying to themselves, and  
a miscellany of excuses has been paraded. The only reason for refusing to  
participate in this project is, quite simply, cowardice. If YOU will not fill  
in a form, at least KNOW YOURSELF clearly enough to understand why.

The next  
step is to come to terms with the situation. Shame caused by, for example, lack  
of courage is a time-wasting emotion; resolving to amend one’s constitution  
simply because one believes the popular view that courage is a Good Thing is  
unlikely to be productive. Those who are able to accept what they are and fully  
understand the reasons why, are then in a position to assess whether, in  
their opinion, any aspect of their character requires improvement and, if  
so, how the improvement should be undertaken.

To quite  
a few people, the question of the Occult Census has been a catalyst in forcing  
self-examination. Very useful, providing they have sufficient wisdom to avoid  
over-reaction. One of our correspondents has announced her intention of  
retiring from Occultism altogether because she is unwilling “to stand up and be  
counted” \[her phrase\]. That will increase, not solve, her problems.

Does one  
need courage to be an Occultist? Don’t give the obvious answer; stop and think.  
Courage is not equated with foolhardiness, disregarding or refusing to face  
facts. It requires intelligence and that grows with knowledge.

The  
Occult Census has confronted us all with a challenge. Just one of the many that  
we have to face, but, for some, it was too hard a test and it came too early.  
Their task now is to avoid regarding one failure as an insurmountable barrier  
to future progress.
