Editorial DL 1

The  
title DARK LILY (Lilium Arcanum) has been used in the past by other followers of the Left Hand Path.  
Its last public appearance was as a duplicated newsheet some five years ago,  
produced by a Satanic group whose pretensions to Occult power could not be  
substantiated (neither they nor their magazine possessed the power of  
longevity).

The  
purpose of the new Dark Lily is to present the truth about the Left Hand Path,  
which is not the weird half-truths and melodramatic claims propagated in the  
past, The reality is far more potent and far more difficult to attain.

This is  
not the magazine of any one group. This is the magazine of the Left Hand Path.  
So, if you have a contribution to make, let us have it. Anything pertinent and  
printable is welcome.

Contributions,  
whether articles, letters or queries, should preferably be typed (double  
spacing) but handwritten items are equally acceptable providing they are  
legible. Please enclose a stamped self-addressed envelope (or IRC if overseas),  
either for our reply, the return of your original, or any questions regarding  
decipherment.

From the Dark Lily Journal No 1, Society of Dark Lily  
(London 1987).
