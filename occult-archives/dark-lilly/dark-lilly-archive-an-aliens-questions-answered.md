AN ALIEN’S QUESTION ANSWERED

It was a  
long, hot summer’s evening. I was just returning from a local meeting of the  
Aetherius Society (hah!) when I noticed something rather unusual taking place.  
A thin, iridescent mist was falling from the sky and soon enveloped me. It  
transformed into a shape that vaguely resembled a human. I blinked, to ensure  
that my eyes were focussing. Then an unearthly human voice spoke to me… “My  
Master from the outer world has sent me with the assignment of investigating  
the beliefs of the inhabitants of the Earth. I have already spoken to a  
Christian, who tells me there is an ‘Almighty God’, but, when I enquired ‘what  
is Satanism?’, he looked upon me with horror and called me an Evil Spirit. Can  
you please tell me what Satanism is?”

Indeed I  
can, follow me…

Religions,  
Christian or otherwise, serves its purpose for the weak individuals, or the  
sheep, as I prefer to call them. They are insignificant little people, who bend  
their knees to a hypothetical superior being called “God”. They cannot  
physically see him and they do not even have any proof of his existence.

Most  
Humans are content to believe in this ‘external super-power’. It is their  
emotional crutch. It is the only thing that keeps these sickly Humans  
functioning.

The only  
belief which is an exception to this is Satanism, which is also the least  
understood, as the average person is unwilling to wake up to reality and the  
authorities treat is as a threat. Indeed, it is a threat to them anyway. If  
there were an upsurge in Satanic philosophy, the system would have to change  
somewhat, and the authorities see this as a dangerous prospect. With this in  
mind, they link with the Christian Church to suppress the masses with  
terrifying propaganda. “Keep away! Lest ye be devoured by evil forces.”

The  
Satanist laughs, as the Christian Bible itself states “God created man  
in his own image.” How true! And who is this ‘God’? It is Man himself.  
(A normal biological process – a continuation of the species.)

Psychiatrists  
say that the average human uses about 3% of his brain capacity. The other 97%  
is “unknown”. In this 97% somewhere is your ‘God’. It is the 97% unexplored. It  
could well be our ‘Occult’, where the unexplained becomes known and the  
impossible becomes possible.

Instead  
of looking for external signs and wonders, as the mystics do, the Satanist uses  
introspection and realises his true potential. The Satanist realises that he  
is, indeed, his own ‘God’. It gives him a greater sense of value and  
self-esteem. We have the victory to overcome all psychological barriers, fear,  
depression, inferiority complexes, as these only make it difficult for us to  
realise our true self. We must love ourselves. Are we not truly divine? If we  
look at some Christian biblical scriptures, taking them metaphorically rather  
than literally, we can expound some sense from them (and some good Satanic  
philosophy!)

GOD THE

 FATHER,  
SON (HOLY  
SPIRIT

FATHER &amp; SON both describe OF  
MAN)

a HUMAN BEING – that being – GOD.

And that God is YOU if you are a  
Satanist!

“Excuse  
me for interrupting,” said the Alien, “but what’s all the talk of sacrifice,  
blood and dancing around an open fire?”

Nothing  
more than a fiction-writer’s over-imagination. A fiction-writer’s aim is to  
sensationalise. He is not interested in facts, only in selling his work. There  
is no such thing as “Black” or “White” Magick – only Magick. It is only the  
intention of the operator which is referred to as either of these. “White  
Magicians” are no better than Christians, who believe in external forces and  
that, by manipulating these forces, they will achieve one-ness with God…  
eventually!.. and adorn themselves in a false sense of spirituality!

The  
Satanist has already achieved one-ness with his ‘God’, his magickal endeavours  
are directed towards ‘materialism’ and are effectively used as weapons if the  
need arises.

We are  
the elite and it therefore makes sense that, in our awareness of our supremacy  
over the conditioned multitudes, though we do not condone their conditioned  
responses to the stimuli which society provides, we leave them to their own  
devices and respect their views. We do not kill or do anyone an injustice…  
unless it is necessary to maintain our survival.

But am I  
right in thinking that Satanists worship someone called ’Satan’ or ‘the  
Devil’?” enquired the Alien.

He who  
affirms the Devil creates or makes the Devil, and that is psycho-logical! When,  
for example, a Magician of whatever persuasion assumes a god-form, he/she  
unknowingly unlocks the door of his/her subconscious and taps into some  
internalised behaviour structures, which exhibit themselves externally in the  
person involved in the ritual. The possession syndrome is obsolete. Demons do  
not exist. They are a facet of the subconscious mind which has been disturbed during  
ritual.

Satanists  
are not restricted by observances of full moons, solstices or equinoxes, as our  
ritual successes do not rely on external forces. This is the main obstacle to  
many newcomers to the Left Hand Path.
