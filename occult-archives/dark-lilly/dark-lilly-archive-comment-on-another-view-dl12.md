COMMENT ON ANOTHER VIEW FOR DISCUSSION (DL11)

Quite  
right too! An understanding with the fundies, these charismatic  
pentecostalists, will never be arrived at by Occultists, or indeed anyone who  
is not a charismatic pentecostalist. You cannot compromise with those who  
believe that they possess the total, unadulterated, 100% accurate and objective  
TRUTH. All you can do is either ignore them, or, if circumstances dictate, step  
on them.

Organised religion/occultism is though not necessarily a  
bad thing. Like growing up, it is something one gets over; though unhappily  
that is not always the case.

To my  
mind, part of the proper aim of Occultism is to define one’s own system of, for  
want of a better word, magick. Clearly one is not going to be in a position to  
do that from scratch, any more than a five-year-old is going to be able to  
design and build a space-shuttle. Organised religion provides a useful place to  
learn about models etc. It is a pity that so many mistake the model for the  
thing itself, but that is, as they say, their problem.

Like  
the proponent of Another View, I  
dislike the trend of certain of the RHP fraternity deliberately to water down  
their beliefs in order to make them acceptable to the masses. While I have  
never met the masses, it is a fair bet that they have no real or enduring  
interest in who you are, what you do or why you do it, and to think that they  
do and base your system on what you think they think is both arrogant and  
delusive to the very few who are searching for that step beyond organised  
religion.

In  
some senses, this trend of “unreasonable reasonableness” can be seen operating  
in the CofE, who are noted for their inability actually to do anything and  
their all-pervading lukewarmeness. Occultism is not about being reasonable or converting  
people, it is about getting on with what you consider to be the work in the way  
you have chosen to get on with it.

In  
short, you show me a “rainbow” witch or any other of these fundie-sired bastard  
forms of Occultist, and I’ll show you a complete prat with delusions of  
grandeur, no capacity for honourable behaviour and an underdeveloped sense of  
self-preservation.

I  
find it almost impossible to believe that these people are so stupid that they  
really believe that, if they help the fundies finish us off, they will then be  
left alone. Yet, as the proverb says, “never underestimate the power of human  
stupidity”.

ANOTHER  
COMMENT: DL’s phrase “RHP lapdogs” should be enshrined in the  
language as a permanent warning to those who still believe we can make common  
ground with such timorous beings. As DL also said, most of the RHP is simply  
dancing around in circles – and it is dancing to the fundies’ tune.
