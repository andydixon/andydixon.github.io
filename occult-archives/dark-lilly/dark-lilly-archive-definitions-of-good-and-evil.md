DEFINITIONS OF GOOD AND EVIL

Readers’ reactions to the first two essays:

A discussion of good and evil –  
were the first two essays (published in DL7) a propaganda exercise for DL?  
Because essay No. 1 was obviously, written by one of the Master’s pupils and  
Essay No. 2 was, also obviously written by a reader who had not imbibed any of  
the DL teaching. Essay One gave a clear definition, albeit with some proviso’s.  
Like the writer, I don’t know whether it is right, but it feels OK and gives an  
acceptable working hypothesis. Essay Two meandered (at length) through  
orthodoxy and came to the conclusion that he/she couldn’t give a definition.  
The moral of all this (if I may use the word) is READ YOUR DLs.

EDITOR: The first two essays  
showed different viewpoints, but it may be that the writer of the above letter  
has stepped into a trap of his own making. Because the first essay was (quite  
obviously) written by a member of the Society of Dark Lily, he assumed that  
that was the “right” definition, so any other must necessarily be “wrong”. A  
new orthodoxy?

If good  
is “balanced” and evil is “unbalanced”, as propounded in Essay 1, that raises  
another question. The question “What is Balance?” which was considered, if not  
answered, in another DL7 article, Extract from a Pupil’s Diary. Would  
that be a more difficult question? In a way, it might be simpler because there  
are fewer preconceptions. Every creed in the world has had a go at Good and  
Evil (mostly showing their own imbalances in the process) but I can’t think of  
anyone except DL who has discussed balance.

EDITOR: We have received more  
contributions to the discussion of Good and Evil, but several have been too  
long and the authors have not yet sent in their abbreviated versions. No  
maximum length was stated, to avoid unnecessary limitation, but please bear in  
mind the practical restriction of space in an issue.
