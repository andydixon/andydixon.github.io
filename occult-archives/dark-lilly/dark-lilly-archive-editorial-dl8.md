EDITORIAL – DL8

Two  
items of bad news in one issue. Firstly, Candid Crest and Black  
Candles have ceased publication; their Editor found the pressures  
insupportable. We regret the loss, but have some idea of the problems which  
were encountered and can understand the very hard decision which was taken.

Secondly,  
we have had to discontinue our exchange advertising with Abrasax and Ganymede  
in view of their Editors’ expressed support for the criminal activity known as  
paedophilia. I am not attempting to place DL in the uncomfortable position of  
arbiter of sexual mores, but such activity is not only illegal, it has nothing  
whatsoever to do with Occultism and could actually impede one’s development, as  
has been explained in DL and in lengthy correspondence with Abrasax and  
Ganymede.

It is  
regrettable that such drastic action as the termination of relations with other  
magazines has become necessary.
