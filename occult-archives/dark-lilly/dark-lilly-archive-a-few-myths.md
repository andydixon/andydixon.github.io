A FEW MYTHS

No religion on Earth is more misrepresented and  
misunderstood than Satanism, not that this worries the Satanists. Black Magick  
or the Black Arts are general terms applied to the Left Hand Path (though not  
used by practitioners). “Black” or darkness is, in this context, associated  
with “evil” and this memory survives from primitive times when man moved about  
freely in daylight but, when night fell, he withdrew to the protective circle  
of light provided by his fire, which kept away hostile animals and anything  
else which might be out there, unseen in the darkness. As Shakespeare said:  
“Present fears are less than horrible imaginings” (Macbeth I:ii.) and, because  
we fear what we do not know, we may unconsciously exaggerate the unknown to  
proportions more terrible than its reality warrants.

It is  
difficult to substantiate claims regarding the origins of Satanism, since it  
has never been the official religion of a state or people. The most  
easily-available proof of its antiquity is in the bible: for instance, the  
legend of Jesus’ encounter with Satan. Satan offered him dominion over part of  
the world in exchange for allegiance, a peculiar tale which, at least, makes it  
obvious that such dominion was possessed by Satan. So the bible’s admission  
that Satan was not only in existence but powerful, at a time before Jesus began  
his campaigning, disposes of the myth that Satanism is merely a negation of and  
rebellion against Christianity.

There is  
no indication that the followers of the Left Hand Path, even if they  
personified their deity, ever represented him with the attributes of cloven  
hooves, horns and tail. These were features of various Pagan nature-gods such  
as Pan and Faunus, and were attached to Satan by the Christians, who regarded  
all other gods as their adversaries and naturally confused them.

The  
Satanists’ best-known symbol has often been mistakenly called “the inverted  
cross”. It has no connection with the Christian cross or the cross used by  
other older religions. The Satanic symbol represents the sword upraised, in  
challenge or acclaim. Pointing  
downward, it would show defeat and surrender. Incidentally, in older and  
therefore more accurate versions of the Tarot cards, the suit of Swords shows  
the weapon upright in the Satanic manner. Only when the cards are reversed  
(with the unfortunate connotations usually attached to a reversed card in a  
fortune-telling spread) does the sword point down.

Necromancy  
is the illogical idea that spirits of deceased persons, if induced to make a  
temporary return to Earth, have, since or by reason of their transition,  
acquired clairvoyant ability, supernatural powers and wisdom.

It was  
essential to the state religion’s thraldom of fear that Death should be  
regarded with terror (despite vague promises of heaven for the few lucky ones).  
The cemetery, the ever present reminder of this dreaded inevitability, was  
surrounded by superstition and horror. The only people who did not regard  
cemeteries with this awe were those who had never accepted the new religion of Christianity  
and therefore understood that the dead were not more dangerous than they had  
been in life.

Cemeteries  
surrounded churches, and churches were often built on the sites of former  
temples. It was natural that the surviving Pagans should wish to meet as near  
as possible to their ancient holy place, since it had been consecrated by those  
with a knowledge of the Earth, a knowledge which has never been available to  
the Christians. The Pagan’s meetings in the grounds of their former temple were  
distorted by the Christians with an allegation that these meetings in the  
cemetery were for the purpose of raising the dead. The people were intimidated  
into regarding all Pagan practices with cringing alarm.
