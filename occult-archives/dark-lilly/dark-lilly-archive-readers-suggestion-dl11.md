READERS SUGGESTION (DL11)

I would like  
to see more dialogue between different Satanic groups and some articles/reports  
on the Left Hand Path in non-English-speaking countries.

We  
would like to hear from other groups. As we have said, no method is  
“right” or “wrong”, it is only right or wrong for the  
individual. Contact with non-English speaking Satanists would be welcome, apart  
from the obvious difficulty (not everyone in the world has learned English). We  
manage some translations, but, if they do not speak English, they will probably  
not be aware of DL. Some months ago, our Editor wrote to every foreign-language  
Occult mag whose address we could find (eleven), suggesting exchange  
advertising. Only one replied and he said no! Any further ideas?

ANOTHER VIEW  
FOR DISCUSSION: We should not be agreeing to a form of logic or moralist with  
Christians. The facts show that Organised Christianity/Christian Fundamentalism  
is a pernicious belief which is anti-social and actively prejudicial to other  
religions and beliefs. An understanding will not work: what is necessary is a  
perception of the evils of all organised religious belief, not an involvement  
of Occultists in a competition to become acceptable to the conditioned and  
twisted minds of the masses.
