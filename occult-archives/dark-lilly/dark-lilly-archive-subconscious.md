SUBCONSCIOUS

All religions preach  
some form of self-denial. In the early days, when religions were aware of their  
true purpose, which was to teach people the control of their subconscious, this  
was the easiest means – for most people the only means – of so doing. I am not  
referring to physical self-denial, such as fasting, but to such prohibitions as  
not seeking revenge, even for a keenly-felt injustice. Whilst people are  
concerned with feuds, rivalry, disagreements, their subconscious rules supreme  
and they will never achieve ascendancy over it or even comprehension of it. So  
the subconscious would much rather have its host embroiled in struggle of any  
kind, for any purpose, because that will lave no energy for the one essential  
without which there is no progress: the mastery of the subconscious.

As time passed and  
understanding was suppressed, self-denial became practised for its own sake and  
few realised the purpose behind it. Orthodox religions became trapped within  
their own empires. The leaders did not want any of their adherents to progress  
towards Adepthood, because such people within a religion would become a focus  
for schism and thereby distract from the power, prestige and wealth of those at  
the top.

Only a  
non-established way, generally known as Occultism, is now able to comprehend  
the possibility that some of its followers could some day achieve the  
enlightenment popularly known as Crossing the Abyss. This is because there are  
no High Priests to be dethroned. Of course there are leaders within Occultism,  
but a general guideline is that, the more magnificent the title, the less  
possibility that he/she will be able to teach anyone anything of use in this  
quest.

Inevitably the  
orthodox religions fear those who practise the methods which they no longer  
dare contemplate, who aspire to an achievement which, in past millennia, was  
the goal of every religion. When knowledge is eclipsed, fear moves in. The  
individuals – for it is only individuals who matter within Occultism – who are  
capable of understanding the real purpose of their work, are a threat to the  
established order of things and those who seek to maintain it. This is not  
because they would incite revolt; that is not the way of the Adept. It is not  
because of what he would do, for he would do nothing. It is his existence that  
is feared, because that conveys the message to all those capable of  
understanding. If one person can liberate himself from the bonds of Earth, it  
is also possible for others do so.
