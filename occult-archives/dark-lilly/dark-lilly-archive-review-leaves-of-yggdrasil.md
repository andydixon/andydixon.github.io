REVIEW

Freya Aswynn’s book:

LEAVES OF YGGDRASIL

This is  
the definitive book on the Northern Tradition: the yardstick against which all  
other Rune-Books will be judged. Much of this material has never before  
appeared in print, and illustrates the deep insights which this talented and  
dedicated Priestess of Odin has been vouchsafed into her chosen Path.

The  
Runes have always been regarded as mysterious, but the fact that this book  
throws a great deal of new light on the subject enhances rather than diminishes  
their fascination, revealing a far more complex theology than had previously  
been known and pointing the way for the reader to pursue his/her spiritual  
quest.

There  
are also detailed sections on divination (beyond mere “fortune-telling”, this  
shows how the Runes are used in psychotherapeutic counselling) and magickal  
work, where the author’s refreshingly candid approach gives the reader all the  
information required. As is explained, the potency of the Runes can make them  
dangerous if mishandled, but there is no hypocritical refuge in “secrecy”; the  
facts are straightforwardly presented and the reader must take responsibility  
for his/her use of them.

The  
final chapter concerns Women’s Mysteries and the pivotal role of women in  
Odinism, far too long misrepresented as a men-only warrior cult. No valid  
system can function without due recognition of half the human race, and Freya  
restores the balance.

216  
pages of comprehensive text and clear line-drawings and diagrams, this book  
offers valuable information to every Occultist, whether or not your way is that  
of the Asatru.
