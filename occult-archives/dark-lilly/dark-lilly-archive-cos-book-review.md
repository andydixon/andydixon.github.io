THE CHURCH OF SATAN

by Blanche Barton. A History of the World’s Most Notorious  
Religion! Available from HELL’S KITCHEN PRODUCTIONS INC. P.O. Box 370, Times  
Square Station, New York. NY 10108-0370, USA.

Twenty-five years  
ago, on April 30, Walpurgisnacht, 1966ev, Anton Szandor LaVey shaved his head  
and declared the beginning of the Age of Satan. From that moment on, both the  
famous and the infamous have found their way through the doors of the Church of  
Satan, with LaVey as its diabolical “Black Pope”.

Blanche Barton,  
Anton LaVey’s authorised biographer, gives a straight-from-the-shoulder account  
of the many strange and sensational events (some heavily documented by a media  
blitz, others related for the first time anywhere) that surrounded LaVey and  
his thousands of followers as they ushered in a new era of indulgence and  
carnality, based on pleasure instead of self-denial. Miss Barton

details the  
evenings spent with LaVey’s Magic Circle, peopled with artists, writers and  
film-makers whose names will be familiar, and points out de-facto Satanists  
throughout history, such as Benjamin Franklin, who would, LaVey is sure, have  
been in favour of a “United Satanic America”.

In addition, Miss  
Barton outlines the direction this ever-growing organisation is taking today,  
in her chapter “Satan’s Master Plan”. And she lays it on the line  
with what every reader will want to know: “How To Perform Satanic  
Rituals” Clearly, no topic has ever been so hot; can you afford not to own  
this book?
