IT’S ALL IN THE MIND

I was  
beginning to get worried. A magazine run by a friend of mine was unusually  
late. Knowing how annoying it is to receive such enquiries as “where is  
it?” or “why is it late?”, I kept quiet. If there was anything I  
could do, he would have contacted me. He didn’t, so I didn’t bother him.

I was just a  
little bit worried. Of course nothing could have happened to him. He’s an  
advanced Occultist, he wouldn’t let it happen. And if the fundies tried to  
hassle him, they’d be up to their necks in law-suits before they knew what hit  
them (and maybe a bot of Black Magick for good measure).

He was busy, that’s all. Still, it was unlike him to be late.

Seeking  
reassurance, I got out my Tarot cards. They provided that assurance quite  
adequately, and also an interesting indication of the mind’s connection with  
the cards. My conscious, logical mind knew that my friend was fine, just busy.  
It was the wayward subconscious that kept pushing up these insidious worries.  
Then the right cards were selected to confirm what I really knew.

How were they  
selected? It’s all in the mind. Like any other aid to clairvoyance. Picking the  
right cards from a face-down pack may be more difficult than seeing the right  
vision in a crystal, but the mind can do it. Our own minds have vastly greater  
powers than many of us can comprehend. Accepting that those powers exist is the  
first step and it is not easy. But you have to be aware of something before you  
can use it. At that stage, maybe one could flip over the Atlantic in the astral  
and check that he was OK. Or maybe one would not need to do so. At that stage,  
such worries would not exist.

I still think  
shuffling a pack of cards is a lot easier than zooming about in the astral. And  
it gives the same result, so why do the job the hard way?

It’s all in the mind.
