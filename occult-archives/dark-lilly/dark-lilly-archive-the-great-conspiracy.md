THE GREAT CONSPIRACY

The Secret Plot (usually  
published in paperback) is to dominate the world. The plotters are the  
Illuminati, the Freemasons, the Jews, the Catholics, the Protestants, the  
Monarchists, the Bolsheviks, or any selected combination. The plot has been  
brewing for anything from a hundred to a thousand years. Their exploits include  
every civil war and revolution in history, every spectacular assassination and  
world economic manoeuvring, especially those which went wrong. Everyone has  
heard the buzz-words like Trilateral and Bilderburg, even if we are not quite  
sure what they mean (financial machinations, and we know who’s the expert at  
that, don’t we?).

The latest “exposee” to land on my desk was about to be  
dropped in the wastepaper basket when I noticed that their arch-plotters of the  
past include William of Orange and, since my ancestor waged a dramatic campaign  
against the Dutchman who became King of England, I started reading.

Twelve  
closely-typed pages later, I felt more in need of headache tablets than rescue  
from the dreaded oligarchy which is scheming to take over the world. If They  
exist at all, they have been working on this sinister plot for centuries and  
are no further forward, so really why should we worry?

I  
noticed that the Conspiracy Theorists who sent me this latest onslaught on the  
world’s diminishing forests (benefactors of the paper industry, if nothing  
else) are also selling their own brand of herbal laxative. That is not merely  
an attempt to balance their budget because paranoia is not a best-seller. Anal  
preoccupation has a significance which presumably they do not realise; Freud  
explained the matter more thoroughly.

No doubt  
conspiracies exist, but the scale and complexity of this one is self-defeating.  
To be a conspirator (even unsuccessful conspirators like these) requires major  
resources of intelligence and expertise; therefore it is an elementary  
deduction that such clever people would find something more productive to do.  
But, if conspiracies did not exist, people would have to invent them.  
Conspiracies are needed. Uniting “us” against “them” is clearly comprehensible,  
but there is a deeper reason. If fighting your enemy is the most important  
action in your life, then your enemy has become the most important person in  
your life.

“Know  
Your Enemy”. To a point, that is useful tactics; beyond that point, it becomes  
a cloak for an obsessive fascination that has more to do with love than hatred.  
The compulsive studying of every facet of the alleged operation is not concerned  
with acquiring weapons to destroy Them; nor is it designed to obtain  
knowledge and thereby promote alliance, because the theorists are aware that,  
if they functioned at that level, they would not be on the outside looking in.

Now that  
we no longer believe in a supernatural being who cares for the welfare of  
Planet Earth and its inhabitants (or some of them), we have to look elsewhere  
for deity. The self-sufficient find it within themselves. The inadequate, aware  
of their own impotence, look outside. A king or dictator has, in the past, been  
a good substitute god, but such rulers are nowadays lacking in charisma (a  
deficiency which may, on the whole, be a good thing). Media over-exposure seems  
a prime cause of this reduction in glamour. To those who need the emotional  
crutch, the object of their worship must, above all, be mysterious. The King  
must not buy his underpants at Marks and Spencer.

The  
Conspiracy is mysterious. Disregard the fact that that is the only thing at  
which is has ever been totally successful. The Conspiracy is whatever you  
imagine it to be. Film-makers are well aware of this archetypal fantasy figure.  
Sitting behind his mahogany desk in his opulent office, the Boss issues his  
orders… He is not benevolent, in fact he is a hard master, but there is  
security in his service and rewards for loyalty.

When the  
Conspiracy takes over, there will be no more wars because there will be no  
opposition. Crime will not be permitted. There will be work and food and  
shelter for all. Breathing is about the most exciting thing that you will be  
allowed to do, but many people would find spiritual haven in that total  
security. It is the new Golden Age, and gold nowadays means economics,  
therefore type-casting the Conspiracy and highlighting the motivations of  
conspiracy-theorists.
