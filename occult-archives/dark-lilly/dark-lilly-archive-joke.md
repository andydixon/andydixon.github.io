JOKE

Or is it?

An  
eighteenth-century sailor was shipwrecked. After drifting on a raft for several  
days, he sighted land. There were not people to be seen as he crawled up the  
beach, but there was a gallows, with the bodies of men, women and children hanging  
from it.

“Thank God!” said  
the sailor. “At least I know I’m in a Christian country!”
