Magic Circle One of the teachings of DL is to look at things from an alternative point of view. Taking this as my starting point I have been thinking about the magic circle.

When you first come across the teaching on the magic circle it is generally described as being a barrier that is created to protect the individual from forces that may otherwise overwhelm his or her consciousness. This is viewing the magic circle from a standard if over-simplistic occult perspective (as I understand it). Metaphorically, the magic circle is a symbol of the DL teaching not to allow external things to have power over you. Putting up a magic circle in this context means detachment from the external. And it seems that it is much easier to visualise a magic circle in the standard context than follow the techniques to manifest the “DL version of a magic circle” in your own life.
