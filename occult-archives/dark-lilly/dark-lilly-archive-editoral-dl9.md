EDITORIAL – DL9

To clarify the position regarding  
advertising in DL: this is not a commercial undertaking and, as long as  
subscriptions cover costs, we do not need paid advertising; this does not mean  
that we will not accept it. Exchange ads are always welcome, but advertisers  
who are not in a position to give a reciprocal service are not excluded. If  
they are offering something which may be of use/interest to our readers, we  
will do our best to find space for it. The primary intention of DL’s advertising  
is to provide information for subscribers. That may shatter another illusion  
about the mercenary motives of the Left Hand Path, but, as regular readers will  
know, we specialise in the demolition of fables.
