REVIEW

THE SECRET LIFE OF A SATANIST

By Blanche Barton

We  
knew that the man who created The Satanic Bible had to be something special,  
but we didn’t know how special. We still don’t know, but we have a clearer  
idea. As Ms Barton says in her book, no-one really gets to know him. The same  
remark could be applied to DL’s Adept; maybe that is one way of recognising a  
rare species.

THE  
SECRET LIFE OF A SATANIST gives much previously unknown biographical  
information about the man who founded the Church of Satan. Fascinating details  
of his childhood, adolescence and early adulthood throw light upon the  
influences which helped shape his interests and eventually led to the  
epoch-making formation of the CoS. There are many more insights into the life  
of Dr LaVey and the personalities who gather around him. And some readers will  
be most interested in the question Did he  
make it with Monroe and Mansfield? Well, what do you think? But this is not  
merely a book of gossip and name-dropping (though it offers quite a few surprises  
along those lines). The Secret Life  
is a well-chosen title. There are glimpses of the very private man, set apart  
from the rest of humanity by the clarity of his vision and intellect. Far  
removed from the Great Showman image that we know. Yet the Showman exists too,  
and more that we can only guess.

So  
many quotes I would like to include but I have to choose just one. In answer to  
the old myth that one has to sell one’s soul to Satan and sign a pact in blood,  
Dr LaVey replies: Come on – souls come very cheap these days. This myth is  
perpetrated by Christian Satanists who are following the lead of medieval  
witch-hunters. Satan demands a much harder task than signing over your soul in  
blood. He demands that you live your life as fully as you can, prosper by your  
own wits and avoid misery. You wouldn’t believe what a tall order that is for  
most people!

As  
well as a biography, the book gives a valuable account of beliefs and practice  
within the Church of Satan. Another indispensable addition to the Satanists  
library.
