AN OMINOUS PARALLEL

He was  
born to undistinguished parents of modest income. His educational achievements  
were not outstanding. And then he announced that he was teaching the One True  
Way. A few enthusiasts believed him, but they gradually became disillusioned  
and drifted away. He died an inglorious death.

Years  
later, his teachings were publicised and many – far more than had followed him  
during his life – espoused the cause with great enthusiasm. Conveniently  
ignoring their mentor’s failings and putting their own interpretation on his  
pronouncements, they proclaimed him the Greatest. Anyone who disbelieved was a  
heretic.

I’m  
writing about Aleister Crowley. Well, who did you think I meant?
