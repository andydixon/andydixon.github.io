Whose Dog Do I walk Today?

How shall I be known when you come  
amongst us. I was asked.

There was only one answer I could  
give.

Not by name, though it be old and  
proved.

Not by my appearance, though we all  
look well as men.

Not by my words, though they be  
few, carefully chosen and cautious.

Nor even by my deeds, though they  
be righteous.

But by the manner of all of  
these.

And, going amongst the very few,  
not the chosen but the born, I was accepted and I was known by all.

Now time was as nothing to me, nor  
distance, nor pain, nor pleasure. Grief, ecstasy, all were as one.

Now I can choose whose dog I will  
walk today.
