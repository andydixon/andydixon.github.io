REACTIONS AND RESPONSES

Everyone  
is conditioned by response. If you tell someone to do something and he won’t do  
it, that is not good for you. If you tell a chair to do something, it cannot do  
it, but it cannot refuse, so you have not had a negative response.

You  
only need so many “No’s” before you will stop looking for “Yes’s”.

A  
well-known cure for depression is, when you wake up in the morning, greet the  
walls cheerfully. It is not what you say, it is how you say it that matters. At  
first, imagine a response from the walls, but there must be a stage when you do  
not need it any more.

You  
must avoid being affected by other  
peoples responses. Their opinions cannot do you any harm. If someone calls you  
a coward, or a fool, or a fraud, or any other insult, do not react. Why should  
you let them have power over you? And you are giving them that power if you  
allow them to affect.

It is  
not enough to show no reaction at the time the insult is proffered. You must  
not brood on it afterwards. You must not plan retaliation. This may sound like  
the Christian teaching of “turn the other cheek”, but, as has been said before,  
adapt anything from any system of belief if it is useful. Very few Christians  
understand the real reason for the advice not to strike back. By striking back,  
you are giving your attacker power over you, power to force you to behave as he  
wants or expects you to behave. This does not, of course, refer to a situation  
when it is necessary physically to defend yourself. In such circumstances, the  
priority is preserving your life or health. However, in such a case, you should  
have been aware of the impending danger so that you were able to circumvent it  
or, at least, to strike first; see “Physinomes” in DL issue 1.

If  
someone dislikes you, that must not disturb or alter your intentions. Equally  
important, and sometimes even more difficult, another person’s liking for you  
must not cause you to deviate from your aims.

By reacting to other people, you are allowing them to  
manipulate you (whether or not they are aware of this). Do not react. Stand  
clear and observe. By remaining emotionally uninvolved, you can assess the  
situation more clearly and, if necessary, control it.
