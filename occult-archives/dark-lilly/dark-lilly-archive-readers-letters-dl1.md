READERS LETTERS’ (DL1)

Pleased  
to hear that DL is making a comeback Under New Management. That title was too  
good to lose. But its brief appearance a few years ago wasn’t the first use of  
the title “Dark Lily”, was it?

ANSWER:  
The earliest known use of the title “Lilium Arcanum” or Dark Lily was in  
1908ev. A member of our editorial staff has seen two sheets, one dated 1908 and  
one 1910, apparently individually written in imperfect copperplate. Although  
she did not have the opportunity to examine these, she believes the person in  
whose possession they were did not have the skill to forge such documents. Any  
further information would be gratefully received. As you say, it’s a good name,  
no matter what its previous pedigree.

Can you  
answer a few questions for me:

1. What  
    is Satanism?
2. What  
    creed or rules do they live by?
3. What  
    would be an ideal Satanist?
4. What  
    sort of people do they despite?
5. How  
    many are there, do they all belong to groups?

ANSWER: Every Satanist would  
probably have a different response to your questions. Our answers to the first  
three are contained in the Dialogue Between Adept and Pupil in this issue.  
Question 4: we do not waste our energy in futile emotions, but we would have no  
time for anyone who follows a set of rules laid down by other people without  
having first thought them through, reasoned them out, and decided that he/she  
agrees with them. Question 5: there are millions of Satanists. A very small  
proportion belong to groups. Many do not feel the need to seek company, and  
many more have not even realised that they are Satanists.

Can you  
tell me how to become a Satanist?

ANSWER: If you truly wish to be  
a Satanist, then you are a Satanist. But you must define your question more  
clearly before it can be fully answered. If you feel the need for a ceremonial  
initiation, you could compose a suitable ritual as outlined in “Teenage  
Satanist” (black candles, parchment and other equipment are available from an  
advertiser in this magazine). If you wish to join a group, you must first  
decide on the type of group; what you can offer to them (not your “soul” –  
no-one but you has any use for that); and what you want from them.
