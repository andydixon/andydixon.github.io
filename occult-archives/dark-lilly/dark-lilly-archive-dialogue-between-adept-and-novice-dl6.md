DIALOGUE BETWEEN ADEPT AND PUPIL

Part 6

MASTER; There is a dangerous trap  
for any Adept or near-Adept: the thing that bites your brains when you realise  
that you have learned too much or what you have learned was not what you  
bargained for.

There has got be something that  
is bigger than the Adept. It does not matter whether it is something you create  
or a situation you put yourself into or allow yourself to slide into, but it  
has got be a very big mental serpent. Because you are an Adept, if this thing does  
not exist, you do not have anything at all with which to compare and judge. You  
need that one thing that is a constant threat to you to retain your  
relationship or relevance day to day at all. You need something that occupies a  
good part of your mind nearly all the time because if that which you have  
created, although dangerous in its own right, is occupying your mind or a great  
part of it, nothing else can, to any real extent. So it is a protective device.

Either Crowley lost control of  
the thing that he created to concentrate on, or he never created one, or things  
that he could not handle filled his mind. There is a perilous dualism. It can  
be anything you like, as long as it takes a lot of handling. A series of  
extremely complex relationships or a very hazardous commission. You become the  
central character in what is, in effect, a massive balancing act. Everything in  
the universe is a question of balance. If, in an unguarded moment, you lose  
your temper over something, if suddenly you let things go… imagine what would  
happen if it were a real animal, hungry, inside you head. Only you and it in  
the room and it is going to tear you to pieces because the balance has been  
neglected. It only takes one link in the animal’s chain to break. If you do not  
control it, it will devour you. Taking a stance gives an animal quite a  
different complexion, more power. There is no need for that.

PUPIL: I  
don’t understand what this thing can be. When you said it could be a dangerous  
commission, I thought at first that you were referring to a very important  
project which you are intending to fulfil in a few years’ time. Then I realised  
it could not be that project, because that is finite; it will be completed. So  
could it be a dangerous commission only if it is something that you will not  
survive?

MASTER: It would not be too  
helpful to go into specifics here, but I think a few readers will have an idea  
of what I am describing. But I must give a warning. I refer to Crowley again  
because he is one of the best-known Occultists, so my meaning will be apparent.  
Crowley and others, I think, went too far too fast. Crowley seriously believed  
he could do anything, withstand, control, conjure everything. I think he did  
that before he learned to own himself so this do-all be-all became a very  
powerful person inside his own head. And that disturbed the balance This is why  
I say always create something bigger, better, cleverer than you. Otherwise you  
have no perspective. Maria Callas, the great opera singer, once said that she  
believed she became a great artiste purely because of a balancing act. She was  
constantly striving for balance between two halves of her brain, one half  
totally rational and lucid, the other half quite the opposite, and, out of this  
perpetual balancing act, came this immense talent.

You can use ritual to represent  
the balancing if you need to see it displayed graphically.

PUPIL: Before  
one gets to the stage where this balancing factor is needed, is it a  
foreshadowing of that experience that Occultists usually have a specific goal  
in mind – something to be achieved before they can go on to further abilities.  
That is not finite unless they decide to stop somewhere along the way, in which  
case they will never need to create such a thing as you were talking about. But  
it is an all-absorbing something that has to be done, and, if one is truly  
concentrating on achieving that ability – the control of one’s subconscious, to  
take an example – one does not get distracted from it into doing other things,  
even if those other things might be a lot more fun. Is that a lower level of  
the balancing factor?

MASTER: It is, if you are using  
it properly. But now you are trying to get a definition again. To say that one  
example of it is a certain thing would not be helpful because it is different  
to every person who experiences it. This has to be so, because all Adepts are  
different. What word for one would probably not work for another.

PUPIL:  
How many Adepts are there in the world at the present time?

MASTER:  
As many as are necessary.

PUPIL:  
Do you know who they are?

MASTER:  
That is not necessary.

PUPIL:  
But, if you met one, you would know. And would he or she also recognise you?

MASTER:  
Yes.

PUPIL: But you never get  
together. Why not? Supposing all the Adepts combined their powers – I know that  
would be taking a stance, but wouldn’t it be worth it? You could literally save  
the world – you could make bombs cease to exist, patch up the ozone layer, make  
forests grow again, revive extinct species –

MASTER: As you just said, you  
understand quite well why we will not do it. Even if such acts were carried  
out, it would alter nothing on the cosmic time-scale. If the bomb was  
disinvented, someone would re-invent it tomorrow.

PUPIL: Yes, I see. If the damage  
to Earth was repaired, the whole process would start all over again, because  
people would not have changed. So is the Earth going to be destroyed, or is it  
going to destroy its inhabitants?

MASTER:  
At this time, it would be of no use to you to know the answers to that or to  
the other usual question of how to prevent either eventuality.

PUPIL: Yet it’s a question which  
so many people have asked. Maybe we are seeking reassurance – though how could  
the answer be reassuring? So are you saying that the world will not be saved by  
Magick?

MASTER: It is known that Earth  
will not exist for ever. A things starts dying as soon as the energy which goes  
into its creation ceases. Regarding Occult intervention, I have explained why  
this cannot take place. An Adept relies on himself first and his Magick second.  
A non-Adept tries to solve everything with Magick. This is illustrated by the  
old legend of the sorcerer’s apprentice, who was told by his Master to clean  
the house, but thought that this task was beneath him. He did not have the  
wisdom so see that it does no-one any harm to clean a house.

PUPIL:  
We have been asked if the LHP has any traditions relating to the millennium or  
the end of the world.

MASTER:  
You cannot conceive a millennium tradition until you can perceive how big the  
time band is.

The  
apocalypse, like truth and beauty, is very much in the eye of the beholder.  
Many people would consider total nuclear war as apocalyptic. If Earth is left a  
glowing, radioactive cinder, who does it really affect?

PUPIL:  
The people who had died – do you mean there would be no effect because there  
would be no-one to react to what had happened?

MASTER:  
Survivors would mourn their loss, so why didn’t they properly appreciate it  
when they had it? The future only becomes important when extinction is near; an  
example of humanity’s childishness. It is one of the curses of humankind that  
they have to be on the verge of losing something before they appreciate it.

PUPIL:  
Are scientists going to continue to invent more powerful weapons?

MASTER: An archer at Hastings  
could not conceive of a more powerful weapon than his bow and arrows. In the  
same way, a private in a missile battery cannot imagine a more effective weapon  
than the one that he guards. Yet there are worse weapons to come, to be  
invented.

PUPIL:  
Will those weapons be used?

MASTER:  
As I have often said, the future is fluid. Actions today begin to shape that  
future. If one course of action is taken, nuclear war results and all other  
options would cease to be; that does not mean that they were not there.  
Whatever you do today, for one reason or another, will preclude something else  
in the future.

PUPIL: Will someone do something  
that precludes nuclear war?

MASTER: That is something which  
you do not yet have to know. You may have an opinion, based on humanity’s  
mental stature and rate of growth in that respect. What would you call someone  
who said ‘enjoy the war, you don’t know what the peace is going to be like?’

PUPIL: I would think he was a  
pragmatist, a realist.

MASTER: It is sometimes better to  
lose a war than to win one, but it takes great courage and intelligence to  
admit it. People who can think are a danger to society.

PUPIL: If the future is fluid,  
but you know what is going to happen, how fluid is fluid?

MASTER: It refers to events which  
humanity can affect. Nothing is going to alter the fact that in X million  
years’ time the Sun will burn itself out. Humanity has the power to decide  
whether or not to burn itself out a lot sooner than that.

PUPIL: I  
wonder why that question of Earth’s survival seems so important, because, even  
if you told us what is going to happen, we could not change it. Should we try  
to stop caring?

MASTER:  
You must not suppress or control your emotions; they are a part of you and you  
must accept that. They must be allowed to exist, but they must not be allowed  
to affect you.

It is  
always the people with strong emotions, even to the point of manic-depression,  
who achieve great things. This is the chief argument against cloning; as only  
stable people would be cloned, the vital inspiration would be lacking. Also, if  
genetic engineers eradicate the gene which causes depression or other mood  
fluctuation, none of the created people, the clones, will have any special  
qualities.

PUPIL: But depression is  
something which most people try to overcome. Is it something which must exist  
in the first place?

MASTER:  
It is a necessary experience, but many people are unable to deal with it or  
choose the wrong method. For instance, it is no use trying to change your  
situation by moving to another area, even another country. The thing that you  
are running away from will follow you there. It will always be with you, for it  
is your own self. Gauguin’s self-exile in Tahiti was a form of suicide, cutting  
himself off from all previous associations. But he could not isolate himself  
from his chief difficulty, himself.

PUPIL:  
Yes, I take the point, having moved a number of times myself. Nowhere has been  
any better than the previous town. Is depression caused by external  
circumstances or is a tendency to depression inherent in some individuals and  
not in others?

MASTER:  
Everything within you is brought about by that mixture of “cells” – the word I  
used in DL2 to describe the process by which each newly-born baby is  
constructed.

PUPIL: You said that everything  
in the universe is available to us through our subconscious. Because of the  
different construction of each human being, does that mean that some people  
would not be able to utilise that power?

MASTER: No, it means that  
most people will not try. They will write it off as unbelievable or impossible,  
and go and play football or watch television instead. A few will not accept  
that anything is impossible. Leonardo da Vinci designed a helicopter but the  
technology was not available to bring it into being. He identified in his own  
personality that one cell that came from someone somewhere where such things  
were in tangible form.

PUPIL:  
Does that mean in the future?

MASTER: The future is the past  
tomorrow. You cannot think of anything that is not. If you can imagine it, it  
is. The moment you think of it, it is possible. This is not to say that it will  
exist, but it has the potentiality for existence. But we will have trouble  
when, somewhere in the universe, we encounter a race which thinks in a different  
way, where perhaps everything is reversed.

PUPIL:  
Are there such beings?

MASTER: This is another question  
to which, at this stage, you do not need an answer. It is sufficient that you  
accept the possibility of their existence. I strike a match and in that spark a  
universe could have been created.

PUPIL:  
That implies there could have been universes created in every match that has  
ever been struck.

MASTER:  
Who do you know that had no happened?
