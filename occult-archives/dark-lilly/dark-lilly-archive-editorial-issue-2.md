Dark lily Editorial Issue 2

As will  
be appreciated, certain subjects cannot be dealt with in great detail in the  
pages of this magazine. For those who wish to probe more deeply into the  
mysteries of their own selves, that is, the mysteries of the universe, a series  
of papers is in preparation (the first is now available). This is not a  
scholastic instruction. There are no set questions, no examinations and no  
timetable. Your progress is an individual achievement and standards of  
comparison are not applicable.

After  
studying each paper, you are invited to write to us with your questions,  
comments and results, as individual guidance is an essential part of this study  
and we recommend that you utilise the opportunity.

There is  
no fee, but a stamped self-addressed envelope (overseas 2 IRCs) must be  
enclosed when requesting a paper and with all letters requiring a reply.

From the Dark Lily Journal No 2, Society of Dark Lily  
(London 1987).
