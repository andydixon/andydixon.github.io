Editorial DL12

The following  
four pages are reproduced by permission of the SORCERER’S APPRENTICE LEGAL  
FIGHTING FUND.

This reproduction  
is necessary because, regrettably, only a comparatively small number of DL  
readers have joined SA and have therefore received a copy of this bulletin. To  
those of you who have joined, we are proud to stand with you. To those who have  
not joined: SAFF is campaigning on behalf of all Occultists. That includes you. The successes already achieved  
and those yet to come, are for the benefit of all Occultists, in Britain and overseas. How much longer are you  
going to sit on the sidelines whilst someone else fights your battles for you?

If this sounds  
like an army recruiting posted… in a way, it is. This is a war. No-one has  
been killed yet (for which you can thank Lucifer, or good luck, or whatever  
else you believe in). But there have been injuries, mental and physical, and  
property has been damaged (SA was firebombed – so we can call this the Second  
Burning Time).

You don’t have to  
stand in the front line. You don’t have to put yourself or your livelihood in  
danger. Chris Bray is doing that; for all of us, to ensure that we continue to  
have the right to practise our beliefs. What we are asking from you is support:  
a donation to the fund; letter-writing when required; information on anything  
relevant which comes to your attention.

When it’s all  
over, the next generation of Occultists is going to ask: “What did you do  
during the Second Burning Time?”

What are you  
going to reply?
