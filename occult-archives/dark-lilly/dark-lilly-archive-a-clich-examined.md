A CLICHÉ EXAMINED

Judeo-Christian  
has become one of our standard pejorative terms, so, before it slips into the  
status of a cliché which is used unthinkingly, let us consider its suitability.  
How far are we justified in equating Jews and Christians? Not very far, in my  
opinion. It was Christians who burned our ancestors at the stake (they burned  
Jews as well). It is the Christians who nowadays accuse us of human sacrifice  
etc. Jews are not into the persecution business, they know only too well how it  
feels to be on the receiving end, not only in the present century but  
throughout the Diaspora.

Without  
Judaism, Christianity would not have existed. Yes, we can blame the Jews for  
that. They didn’t like it at the time and they did their best to stop it, but,  
not being very good at oppression, they did not succeed.

I am  
not suggesting that we have any common ground. I do not know much about Judaism  
and, what little I know, I do not agree with. Leaving theologies aside, we  
should respect them. They have come through far worse sufferings than we have  
ever endured, and have remained steadfast. They have never tried to inflict  
their religion on others or harmed those who have disagreed with them (not  
since Old Testament times anyway, and that’s too far back to blame present  
exponents).

Judaism  
demonstrates little or no similarity with Christianity. Judaism is sufficiently  
aware of its own validity to be able to accept that other faiths have the right  
to exist. Christianity does not have such self-confidence and its attacks on us  
are manifestations of its insecurity.

We  
have only one adversary. Don’t dissipate your energies. Sure, the Jews say that  
Satanists are evil and they don’t want to talk to us. That’s their privilege.  
Christians say that Satanists are evil and they want to exterminate us. There  
is a hell of a difference.
