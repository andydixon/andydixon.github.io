HYMN TO SATAN

I  
animate all who fight against servitude

The  
heroes and martyrs of liberty and progress in every

 age  
have drunk of my spirit

I  
inspire the revolter, the scorner, the sceptic,

the satirist

I  
distribute the tree of knowledge

I am the  
lightning of the human mind

I am the  
soul of the world

I level  
the thrones and altars and annihilate binding customs

With a  
goal of restless aspiration, I urge men on

 until  
they outgrow faith and fear

 until the slave stands erect before the  
tyrant

 and defies his curse.

(Composed  
during the Renaissance, when people were at last beginning to break free of the  
state religions which had oppressed and brainwashed them for one and a half  
millennia.)

From the Dark Lily Journal No 1, Society of Dark Lily  
(London 1987).
