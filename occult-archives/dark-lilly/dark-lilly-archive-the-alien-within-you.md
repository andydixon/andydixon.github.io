THE ALIEN WITHIN YOU

There are rules which govern the  
Universe and everything in it, but there are no absolutes. At conception, you  
are made up of a random bunch of “cells”   
(as previously explained, this is the essence of your being and does not  
refer to physical cells). When you die, your cells go back into the pool of  
energy which is the Universe. This energy has been there for ever and it is a  
finite amount. It is made up of everything in the Universe, many other  
life-forms of which most people on Earth are unaware.

Visualise  
the Universe as a huge sphere with each type of life-form existing  
independently in its own area. When an individual representation of a life-form  
dies, its cells are returned to that part of the Universe nearest to that  
life-forms area of existence, for example a planet. At the conception of each  
new manifestation of that particular life-form, the nearest cells are scooped  
up, so naturally the same type of life-form continues to come through in that  
area or on that planet. Babies born on Earth are in recognisably human form. On  
the rare occasions that too many cells of a different life-form are gathered up  
in one scooping, the entity does not survive in what is, to it, a hostile  
environment.

As cells  
are returned to the Universe-pool, most remain within their own area, but a few  
are spread wider, like the ripples on a water-pool. This is a continuing  
process. Many people on Earth have one or more cells of an alien life-form  
within their essence, just as the creatures a million light-years away have a  
very small proportion of homo sapiens. Usually this is buried deep  
within the subconscious and remains hidden.

This is  
the explanation for the phenomenon know to science (because science has to  
simplify and pigeonhole it) as atavism. “Return to a primitive state” dos not  
properly address the issue at all, but it is the nearest they can come to it.  
If that cell within you is from a totally different mode of existence and  
culture, you have no means of defining it or acknowledging it. Unrecognised, it  
manifests itself weakly; once you have recognised and confronted it, it knows  
that it exists and exists separate of you. It is not a demon, it is a cell from  
a different life-form. When you have found that cell, you cannot get rid of it.  
Like every other aspect of the subconscious, it thinks that it has a right to  
live.

An early  
symptom of the dawning recognition of an alien cell within one’s being is  
totemism, belief that one has within one’s psyche the spirit of an animal or a  
bird (most frequently a wolf or a raven). It happens to beginners on the Occult  
path. They accidentally give this cell a prod and, because they are not  
sufficiently advanced to comprehend what it really is, they select the  
Earth-creature which is reputed to have certain characteristics corresponding  
to those which they have noted within that cell. In extreme cases, they may  
even come to believe that they have the ability to change into the wolf, raven  
or other species. Everyone who has claimed another form has always selected a  
creature that is of Earth, though the Universe has been around longer than  
ravens or wolves.

Totemism  
is not, as generally believed, merely a flight of fancy or an ego-trip. It is  
an indication of those who have begun to make progress. Others who have not  
explored themselves have never come face to face with the bit that does not  
fit.

A  
thousand or a million light-years away, their creation and un-creation is  
exactly the same as ours. It is all from the same pool.
