SOLIDARITY

From the neck upwards…?

If you received a  
letter stating: “It is my intention to bring together the various factions of  
the Left Hand Path”, what would you do?

(a) think “it’s a good idea but he hasn’t  
got a chance”:

(b) file it in W (Wastepaper Basket);

(c) think “Lucifer protect us from such  
fools!” (or words to that effect).

If the Left Hand  
Path got “united” (never mind how), I would go away and form something else.  
There are certain Satanists with whom I would not dine, much less share a  
magickal experience. I am not referring to pseudo-Satanists, nor am I intending  
any criticism of table-manners; quite simply, they bore me stiff.

There are as many  
methods as there are groups, and anyone starting out on the Left Hand Path has  
a variety of choices (he/she may not get it right first time, but it’s all  
useful experience). Even the orthodox religions have recognised that, within  
their own confines, they must offer some divergence of practice or dogma. If  
the Left Hand Path vouchsafed one way only (it matters not if that was the  
right way, though who on Earth or anywhere else would be the judge?) it would  
mean that fewer people had a chance of getting where they want to go.

Another problem is  
that none of the (very few) Adepts capable of directing such an augmented  
structure would be prepared to take on the job. The New Improved Left Hand Path  
Union would have to be left by a less highly-qualified being who was willing to  
accept the responsibility because he thought it would be a good thing if  
someone did it; not exactly a recipe for success. Or it would be administered  
(Satan help us!) by a committee. There might even be adopted the fashionable  
democratisation, which has brought about the phenomenon of a High Priest (or  
whatever titles) who does not claim supreme authority. Hard to understand why  
that is not more popular, it’s a really cushy number. He has all the glory,  
despite his modest disclaimers, but, when something goes wrong, he has plenty  
of people to blame.

One small consolation,  
the New improved etc would not be taken over by a megalomaniac because the Left  
Hand Path has an uncanny habit of puncturing inflated egos. We know that no-one  
else can promise us dominion over the universe; when we have dominion over  
ourselves, everything else follows. There remains the uncomfortable realisation  
that the New Improved etc would be run by someone who, however sincere his (or  
her) motives, is not really up to the job.

I’m old fashioned; I  
would rather kneel at the feet of a true Adept who knows where he is going  
(and, also important, where he has been) than be accepted as an equal colleague  
by a poseur. This only applies to my Occult quest; if I lived under a despotic  
government, I would be at the barricades. Which illustrates a vital point: we –  
any of us – will tolerate a lot more from a High Priest than from a President  
or Prime Minister. But let us not suspend too much of our critical faculty;  
that would benefit neither pupils nor teacher.

And the Great God  
Unity is a false idol, as phoney as… but the next item of iconoclasm can wait  
until the next article.

Comment by the Adept  
when he read the foregoing article: To know where one is going needs knowledge  
of the future, The future is fluid and only solidified by the actions of today.
