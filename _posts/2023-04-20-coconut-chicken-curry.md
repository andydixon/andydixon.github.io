Hereâ€™s a recipe for a delicious and flavorful coconut milk-based chicken curry that is mild in heat yet rich in taste:

Ingredients:

- 1.5 lbs (680g) boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp fresh ginger, grated
- 1.5 tsp ground turmeric
- 1.5 tsp ground cumin
- 1.5 tsp ground coriander
- 1/2 tsp paprika
- 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp ground cardamom
- 1 can (13.5 oz / 400ml) coconut milk
- 1 cup (240ml) chicken stock
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- 1/2 tsp sugar
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 2 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch (2.5cm) cubes
- 1/2 cup frozen peas
- Fresh coriander, chopped, for garnish
- Cooked rice, for serving

Instructions:

1. Heat 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the chicken pieces and cook until browned on all sides, about 4-5 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.
2. Add the remaining tablespoon of vegetable oil to the skillet. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger, and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.
3. Stir in the ground turmeric, ground cumin, ground coriander, paprika, ground cinnamon, and ground cardamom, and cook for 1 minute to toast the spices.
4. Pour in the coconut milk and chicken stock, stirring to combine. Add the tomato paste, sugar, salt, and pepper, and mix well.
5. Return the browned chicken to the skillet, along with the cubed potatoes. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer, covered, for 20-25 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender and the chicken is cooked through.
6. Stir in the frozen peas and cook for an additional 5 minutes, until the peas are heated through.
7. Taste the curry and adjust the seasonings as needed. Serve the curry over cooked rice, garnished with chopped fresh cilantro.
