Understanding “Paint It Black” requires a recognition of the era in which it was created. The 1960s were a time of significant societal upheaval, with the Vietnam War, civil rights movements, and cultural revolutions shaping the landscape. These influences might have imbued the song with a more profound sense of disillusionment, despair, and existential questioning.

The song’s themes align with existentialist philosophies that explore meaning, choice, and individual existence. The desire to paint everything black could symbolize the existential crisis, where traditional values and meanings are questioned, leading to nihilism or a profound sense of emptiness.

The use of the sitar and the song’s cyclical structure may hint at influences from Eastern philosophies like Buddhism. The desire to obliterate color and sensory experience might be interpreted as a longing for transcendence or escape from the suffering of existence.

The lyrics of “Paint It Black” delve into complex psychological states. The song could be seen as an expression of profound grief and depression. The imagery of everything turning black aligns with the experience of bereavement, where joy, color, and vitality are drained from life.  
The repeated desire to paint objects black reveals an obsessive tendency. This compulsion might symbolize a struggle to control or make sense of chaotic emotions and experiences.  
The reaction to seeing girls in summer clothes shows an inability to connect with everyday joys and pleasures. This disconnect could symbolize a deeper fear or aversion to happiness itself, possibly stemming from trauma or existential dread.

The song’s dark, emotive tone and focus on individual experience may connect to the Romantic literary and artistic movement, where emotion and nature were central themes.

The song is rife with symbolism, from the red door representing love or life to the black color symbolizing death, endings, or a void. The use of color as symbols creates an allegorical narrative that can be interpreted on multiple levels.

Beyond personal emotions, the song could be read as a critique of societal norms and expectations, perhaps reflecting the disillusionment with materialism, superficiality, or the loss of innocence in a changing world.

The melding of rock with the sitar creates a haunting, almost otherworldly sound. This unique combination adds to the song’s mystique and resonates with its themes of dichotomy, conflict, and transcendence.

“Paint It Black” is a rich and complex song that defies simple interpretation. Its depth comes from a weaving of historical and cultural context, philosophical undertones, psychological explorations, literary and artistic connections, social commentary, and unique musical composition.

The song captures a universal human experience of despair, longing, conflict, and existential questioning. Its lasting appeal lies in its ability to resonate on multiple levels, reflecting the complexities of human emotion and thought.
