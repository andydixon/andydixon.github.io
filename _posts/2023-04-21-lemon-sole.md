Hereâ€™s a simple and delicious pan-fried lemon sole recipe with a lemon-butter sauce:

Ingredients:

- 4 lemon sole fillets (about 4-6 oz / 115-170g each)
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1/2 cup (60g) all-purpose flour, for dredging
- 3 tbsp vegetable oil
- 2 tbsp unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup (60ml) fresh lemon juice
- 1/4 cup (60ml) dry white wine (optional)
- 2 tbsp capers, drained and rinsed
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
- Lemon wedges, for serving

Instructions:

1. Pat the lemon sole fillets dry with paper towels and season both sides with salt and pepper.
2. Place the all-purpose flour in a shallow dish or plate. Dredge each fillet in the flour, shaking off any excess.
3. In a large non-stick skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Carefully add the fillets to the skillet, cooking in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding. Cook the fillets for 2-3 minutes on each side, until golden brown and cooked through. Transfer the cooked fillets to a warm plate and cover loosely with foil to keep them warm.
4. Remove any remaining oil from the skillet and reduce the heat to medium-low. Add the butter to the skillet and let it melt. Add the lemon juice and white wine (if using) to the skillet, stirring to combine and scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.
5. Cook the sauce for about 2 minutes, allowing it to reduce slightly. Stir in the capers and cook for an additional minute.
6. Return the cooked lemon sole fillets to the skillet, spooning the sauce over the top. Sprinkle the chopped fresh parsley over the fillets and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until heated through.
7. Serve the lemon sole fillets with the lemon-butter sauce and lemon wedges on the side. This dish pairs well with steamed vegetables, rice, or a simple salad.
