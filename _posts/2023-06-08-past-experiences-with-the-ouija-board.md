The Ouija Board, also known as a spirit board or a talking board, has been a subject of intrigue and fear for over a century. Its origins lie in the spiritualist movement of the 19th century, and it was designed to facilitate communication with the ‘other side’. Whether you view it as a harmless game or a potent tool for communicating with the paranormal, numerous stories abound about the uncanny experiences people have had with these boards. This article explores a compilation of such past experiences, showing the fascinating range of human interaction with the unknown.

1. The Winchester Mystery House Experience

Our first story comes from the infamous Winchester Mystery House in San Jose, California. The sprawling mansion is said to be haunted by the spirits that fell victim to the Winchester rifles, leading Sarah Winchester, the widow of the firearm magnate, to continuously build the house to appease them.

One group of tourists, during a late-night visit, decided to bring along a Ouija board. They attempted to make contact with the spirits supposedly residing in the house. They asked a series of questions, and to their surprise, the planchette began to move. One participant, noticeably frightened, decided to ask, “Who are you?” The planchette spelled out, “S-Winchester.” No further details were given, but this chilling encounter remains vivid in the minds of the participants.

2. The Dorm Room Encounter

In a college dorm room in the late 90s, a group of students decided to use a Ouija board out of curiosity and boredom. They made contact with what they believed was a spirit who called itself “Rosa”. Rosa claimed to have died in the 1800s, providing personal details that later checked out when the students researched local archives. Whether an actual spirit or a subconscious projection, this encounter had the students sleeping with their lights on for a week.

3. The Predictive Warning

One remarkable experience comes from a family who claimed the Ouija board predicted a future event. The family, who regularly played with the Ouija board, once received a message warning them of an impending car accident. Shaken but skeptical, they dismissed it as a random message. However, days later, their family car was involved in a minor accident. While no one was hurt, the incident made them rethink their stance on the board’s messages.

4. The Spirit Named ‘Zozo’

The internet is filled with stories of encounters with a supposed spirit or entity named ‘Zozo’. One such experience comes from a man who played with a Ouija board in the early 2000s. The session started as usual until the planchette started moving in a strange pattern, oscillating between ‘Z’ and ‘O’. It claimed to be ‘Zozo’, a spirit known to many Ouija board users for causing fear and unease. Despite discontinuing the session, the man reported a series of strange happenings following the encounter, such as nightmares and unexplained noises.

While these stories provide a thrilling sense of the unknown, it’s essential to remember that scientific consensus does not support the Ouija board’s paranormal claims. Psychologists often explain these experiences with the ideomotor phenomenon, where individuals make motions unconsciously. However, regardless of the reason, these experiences have undeniably left a significant impact on those involved. Whether you consider it a game, a spiritual tool, or simply a piece of cultural history, the Ouija board continues to be a source of mystery and fascination for many.
