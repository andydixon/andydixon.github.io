“Hotel California” is a classic rock song by the American band the Eagles, released as the title track from their fifth album in 1976. Written by Don Felder, Don Henley, and Glenn Frey, the song has been subject to various interpretations since its release. However, the primary intention of the songwriters was to convey a message about the excesses, materialism, and disillusionment of the American Dream, particularly in the context of the Southern California music scene during the 1970s.

The song tells the story of a weary traveller who comes across a mysterious hotel, “Hotel California,” while driving on a dark desert highway. The hotel appears to be inviting and welcoming at first, but the traveller soon realizes that it is a place of decadence, excess, and inescapability. The lyric, “You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave,” emphasizes this sense of entrapment.

The song’s narrative is often interpreted as a metaphor for the music industry, and more broadly, for the seductive lure of fame, fortune, and hedonism that characterized the Southern California lifestyle at the time. The Eagles have also explained that “Hotel California” is an allegory about the loss of innocence, the disillusionment that can come with pursuing one’s dreams, and the stark realization that success often comes at a high price.

Despite the various interpretations, “Hotel California” has become an iconic song in the history of rock music and continues to be celebrated for its captivating storytelling, intricate guitar work, and memorable melody.
