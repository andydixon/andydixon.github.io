Control, developed by Remedy Entertainment, is a visually captivating and thought-provoking third-person action-adventure game that takes players on a thrilling journey through the enigmatic world of the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC). Set within the shifting walls of the Oldest House, a brutalist skyscraper in New York City, the game’s protagonist, Jesse Faden, embarks on a quest to find her long-lost brother, Dylan, while uncovering the secrets of the mysterious organization.

In this article, we will delve into Control’s storyline, exploring its intricate narrative and the fascinating concepts introduced throughout the game, including the expansion packs: The Foundation and AWE.

Main Storyline

Jesse Faden arrives at the FBC headquarters seeking answers about her missing brother, Dylan, who was taken by the organization years ago. Upon her arrival, Jesse finds the Oldest House in chaos, with the FBC’s personnel either missing, possessed, or killed by a malevolent force known as the Hiss.

As Jesse explores the building, she discovers the body of the FBC’s former director, Zachariah Trench, who had committed suicide. Jesse then picks up the Service Weapon, a supernatural object that binds itself to her, making her the new director of the FBC. With the aid of the mysterious janitor, Ahti, Jesse learns about the Astral Plane, a separate dimension that connects to the Oldest House, and the Board, a group of extradimensional beings that govern the FBC.

Throughout her journey, Jesse encounters various Objects of Power (OoP), which are ordinary items imbued with supernatural abilities. By cleansing these OoPs, Jesse obtains new abilities, such as telekinesis and levitation, to combat the Hiss and restore order within the Oldest House. She also encounters the enigmatic Dr. Casper Darling, the FBC’s head of research, who communicates through pre-recorded messages and guides Jesse in her quest.

As Jesse uncovers the truth about her brother and the Hiss, she learns that the FBC had experimented on both her and Dylan as children after they were exposed to an AWE (Altered World Event) in their hometown of Ordinary. Jesse ultimately confronts and defeats the Hiss, rescuing her brother, who is left in a comatose state.

The Foundation DLC

In the Foundation DLC, Jesse is tasked with investigating the origins of the Oldest House, which leads her to the Foundation, a subterranean area beneath the building. The Astral Plane is bleeding into the Foundation, threatening the entire structure of the Oldest House. Jesse must navigate this dangerous new environment, filled with hazardous chasms and hostile creatures, while discovering the secrets of the mysterious Board.

Jesse encounters Helen Marshall, the FBC’s Head of Operations, who had disappeared earlier in the main storyline. Together, they work to stop the Astral Plane’s invasion by repairing the Nail, a colossal structure that stabilizes the connection between the Oldest House and the Astral Plane. Jesse faces off against the former head of security, Simon Arish, who has been corrupted by the Hiss, and defeats him to restore order in the Foundation.

AWE DLC

The AWE expansion pack delves into Altered World Events, which are supernatural occurrences that the FBC investigates and contains. Jesse is called to the Investigations Sector of the Oldest House to confront a new threat: a creature known as the Third Thing, which had previously been contained in the Bright Falls AWE. This creature is heavily connected to the events of Alan Wake, another game developed by Remedy Entertainment.

Jesse discovers that the Third Thing, also known as the Dark Presence, is linked to the writer Alan Wake, who had been trapped in the Dark Place, an alternate dimension, for years. Wake had been writing a story that bridged the gap between his world and the world of Control, trying to manipulate reality to escape his confinement. To do so, he created the character of Thomas Zane, a poet who could control reality with his verse.

Jesse navigates the Investigations Sector, facing off against supernatural forces, including the Hiss-infected Hartman, a former psychiatrist from the town of Bright Falls. As she delves deeper into the AWE, Jesse learns more about the connection between Alan Wake and the FBC, as well as the role of Thomas Zane in the larger narrative.

Eventually, Jesse manages to contain the Dark Presence and rescue Alan Wake from the Dark Place. With Wake’s help, Jesse strengthens the connection between their worlds, allowing the FBC to better understand and counteract the forces behind Altered World Events. The AWE DLC concludes with a potential hint at a sequel, as Wake is now free to continue his story outside the Dark Place, and the FBC must prepare for the unknown future.

Conclusion

Control weaves a captivating and complex narrative, blending supernatural elements with a deep, character-driven story. As players follow Jesse Faden through the mysterious Oldest House, they are challenged to unravel the secrets of the Federal Bureau of Control, the Astral Plane, and the Altered World Events that bind the game’s universe together.

With the addition of The Foundation and AWE DLCs, the world of Control expands even further, introducing new characters, enemies, and environments, as well as providing a deeper understanding of the game’s core concepts. The game’s rich storyline and immersive atmosphere make Control a standout title in the action-adventure genre, with its unique blend of mystery, suspense, and supernatural intrigue leaving a lasting impact on players long after the final credits roll.
